"Punished for being honest, guest rewarded for lying","I feel completely let down by Airbnb.A guest booked for one person, but two showed up at check in. Days later we discovered three were actually staying, and the first to arrive was not even the booker but his father and wife. Despite having proof, Airbnb took no action.The same guest reported a shower issue six days into the stay. We immediately replaced the boiler at our own expense. My father worked six hours to install it. The problem was resolved within days, yet Airbnb still issued a refund as if there had been no hot water for many nights, which simply is not true.Airbnb lastly blamed us for not reporting the breach of number and identity of guests, but we only found out a week into the booking.We acted quickly, spent money, and tried to do everything right, but Airbnb rewarded dishonesty and left us feeling powerless and disrespected.",1
They don't even have a proper system in place for refunding specific receipts,"If only I'd seen the trustpilot score before booking!Avoid Airbnb at all costs - especially if travelling on business.My case was a simple one, yet Airbnb were completely unable to provide a solution, despite days of correspondence with them, a phone call, and an understanding host who had already agreed to the refund.A complete waste of my time, and loss of my money.I was travelling on business, therefore my employer paid for 5 nights accommodating using one of the business credit cards (transaction 1).I was travelling with my baby and wife, so I personally sent an additional payment to the host for a cot and high chair using my own credit card (transaction 2).There were problems with the accommodation when we arrived (which the host acknowledged and agreed to provide us a refund for).Therefore, I needed two separate refunds, made to the two separate cards and bank accounts that had been used.1. Refund to my employer for the accommodation (transaction 1)2. Refund to myself for the extras (transaction 2)This shouldn't be difficult, because Airbnb had provided separate receipts, each with their own receipt ID.I needed a partial refund for receipt ID 1 (to my employer) and a full refund for receipt ID 2 (to myself).They couldn't manage this simple task!The first person I spoke with on the chat couldn't understand how I had made two payments, especially that one of which was not my bank account. Surely traveling on business isn't this alien to Airbnb!?No matter who I spoke to, they sent the refund to the employer, citing that it had to be sent to the original payment, and completely neglecting the fact there were 2 payment methods.Even when I provided the receipt ID RCT9RMWEPW, they were unable to send me a refund for this.Airbnb even further explained that there would be no option for the host to select how to refund me through their platform (i.e. The host is unable to send the correct refund). Additionally they can't cancel incorrect refunds (even when all parties are agreed!).So basically support is completely useless. I'm now out of pocket.They have refunded my employer but not refunded my own expenditure, made via their platform, even starting that this is impassible, despite me having provided the receipt ID.I work for a large organisation, trying to tracing this refund and then claiming the money back is going to be an absolute nightmare, if not impossible. The expense isn't a business expense, that's why I paid it with my own card.When a company is this incompetent over something so basic, a flaw that could affect millions of travellers, then you can't possibly trust them to rectify more complex issues.The platform is not fit fit purpose.",1
Platform itself is easy to use but the…,Platform itself is easy to use but the rules that are set up make it challenging from host to host. We enjoy non hotel trips still. Costs are starting to even it though.,3
Avoid at all costs.,"Avoid at all costs.- their hosts can cancel you a confirmed stay- as a ""solution"" Airbnb provides you a list of stays 30km away with prices 50-100% up- Airbnb intentionally forbids you from putting a honest review on such unreliable hosts so you are unable to warn the others- their customer support is full of nice pre-fabricated sentences, solves nothing and then blocks you to not to disturb them again",1

We had to cancel to one of our friends having to have a back surgery and would no longer be able to travel. This was for a special occasion for him. Airbnb and the host have declined to refund any money. There is no customer service or support. Avoid at all costs.",1
Airbnb.. worst experience ever overnight,"Was part of the group of 7 people who stayed at this place. Everything about this apartment was a lie, most things broken and not working on the place, smelled like weed, a/c barely working, refrigerator broken, toilets wouldn’t flush, every piece of furniture was broken in some way.  The worst part was that it’s located in the worst part of town, and a very unsafe feeling all around the place.  Could go on for hours about how bad the experience was… 1300 Crossing Place 522Austin, Texas 78741United States of AmericaI will never use an Airbnb ever again in my life.  Can only hope someone will learn from our mistake.",1
Serious safety issue ignored and case mishandled,"I recently had a very disappointing experience with Airbnb. During my stay, water leaked directly from the bathroom light fixture for four days in a windowless bathroom, creating a clear risk of fire and electrocution. Despite providing evidence and reporting this immediately, Airbnb treated it as a minor “amenity issue” and offered me just €75 in compensation.Even more troubling, the host pressured me to remove my review in exchange for a refund. I refused, because I wanted to respect Airbnb’s rules and trust their process. Unfortunately, this left me worse off — Airbnb closed my case without taking the safety risk or the host’s misconduct seriously.This experience has completely undermined my trust in Airbnb’s promise to “have guests’ backs.” If safety hazards and review manipulation are brushed aside in this way, it is hard to see how guests can feel protected by the platform.",1
I recently booked with BRIAN LAMBERT in…,I recently booked with BRIAN LAMBERT in  LENOIR NC and his amenities were not at all what he described. The listing says he has a stove and all he has is a hot plate! That's just one of the many lies he uses to describe this space. We also had ants throughout the entire unit for our stay and he said we brought them with us!!! of course I complained to him and he wrote a review saying I was combative and he does not recommend me to anyone else. I spent hours on the phone and did two request to remove this review and had all of the proof and pictures to support the truth and they denied the removal of the review both times that he did on me! Absolutely ridiculous because I had all of the proof! Won't be using AIRBNB again!,1
"What an awful experience,it is very…","What an awful experience,it is very difficult to have a conversation over the telephone due to the language barrier. Too many problems so cancelled. Under no circumstances would I use ABNB. I am awaiting my refund. Be warned",1
Airbnb allowing hosts extort money from…,"Airbnb allowing hosts extort money from the guests.By mistake I booked an accommodation for 1 person instead of 3. While amending the booking, the host asked 3 times the cost of the apartment. ( 330€ instead of 110€). Normally only extra city tax was to apply. I rejected host’s offer and he cancelled my booking. I lost the money I paid and the host refused me to check in (even alone).Despite of me providing the screenshot of differential I had to pay on this apartment (extra city tax),I was explained by Airbnb that I had to accept the amendment (330€)..I had the impression that all people of Airbnb support were merely bots 🤖",1
Avoid at all cost,"Man, the rating on Trustpilot and their stock performance over the last 5 years really speaks for itself.Company loosing it value.Per definition.Honestly, Airbnb has the best UI. But underneath the facade, the company is super ugly.Honestly, I would try to avoid them at all cost.I got blocked because one host wasn't returning my property and kept lying to me that he could not access the apartment, even though I saw the profile was being booked.I told him he will see I will go to the police.Then Airbnb just blocked me without naming any specific reason.Because they support thieves, don't hold them accountable and even support them.Emotionally immature, incompetent company.AVOID AT ALL COST.",1
Airbnb offers NO real protection,"​Booked an Airbnb for £1,577 (2 nights, 6 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms). Reality: no hot water for hours, one bathroom unusable all day, tradesmen drilling inside for 5+ hours — with multiple babies in the house.Airbnb’s “Guest Refund Policy” promises protection if essential amenities fail or if the property isn’t as described. All applied, yet they dismissed it as “no violation” and offered a token $200. Only by going through my credit card company did I claw the money back.Airbnb does not protect guests. Their policies mean nothing in practice. Book with extreme caution — you’re on your own if things go wrong.",1
Airbnb is showing outrageous injustice,"Airbnb is showing outrageous injustice. People from Russia cannot use the service just because they live in Russia. This is pure discrimination based on nationality. Airbnb is depriving a huge group of people of the right to use its platform, to travel freely, and to choose accommodation — following double standards instead of principles of equality and accessibility.Such treatment of customers is absolutely unacceptable in the modern world. Instead of bringing people together, the platform deliberately divides them and punishes them for their origin and place of residence.Airbnb must reconsider this shameful practice, otherwise it will remain branded as a company that violates basic human rights and discriminates on the basis of nationality.",1

Excellent Customer Services…,"I had to contact Airbnb as my recent trip did not meet my expectations on may levels - the host's problem I may add.  Airbnb handled my concerns with extreme empathy, kept me updated and even called me.  My issue was resolved within 36 hours of me first raising the issue.  I found this style of customer care to be outstanding. Thank you, especially Minhaj & May (Case manager) for really helping me to go from unhappy (due to my trip) to happy. ☺.",5
System Cybersecurity Threat Weaknesses,"My experience with Airbnb highlights failures that raise not only customer service concerns but also potential regulatory and legal exposure.Prior to my stay, the host contacted me through Airbnb’s own platform and attempted to coerce me into providing payment details via an off-platform website under threat of cancellation. The link triggered an immediate phishing/security alert in my browser. When I reported this, Airbnb customer service advised me to “keep trying.” Instructing a consumer to bypass a security warning and reattempt access to a suspected phishing site represents a reckless disregard for data security. This response is inconsistent with basic cybersecurity standards and could place Airbnb in violation of consumer protection and data security obligations under U.S. federal and state law. A former member of Airbnb’s own legal department later acknowledged this as a serious lapse.Following the stay, matters deteriorated further. Weeks after checkout—and beyond Airbnb’s review and dispute window—the host accused me of stealing a spoon and demanded $10. This baseless allegation, unsupported by any timely evidence, was nevertheless entertained by Airbnb. By siding with the host, Airbnb effectively validated a frivolous claim, raising additional concerns about the integrity of its dispute resolution process.Together, these incidents reflect systemic weaknesses in Airbnb’s handling of cybersecurity threats and post-stay disputes. They expose guests to fraud, undermine trust in the platform, and suggest possible breaches of Airbnb’s duty of care and obligations under consumer protection law.",1
Completely greedy corporation,Completely greedy corporation. Rigged reviews.,1
This platform is such a pain to deal with,"I have been using Airbnb for 12 years but so wish there was a good alternative. Customer service is absolutely useless, even harmful. As a guest, I was scammed by hosts and the customer service in fact facilitated that. As a host and guest, I have repeatedly experienced that customer service attendants lack basic reading comprehension to understand and respond to simple questions.",1
Terrible experience,Terrible experience. We rented and paid well for a home in Rome. We are excellent tenants. I followed up with the host before I posted my review and she thanked us for cleaning the apartment and  being good renters. I gave the host a 5*. Seems the host never finished our review and although I spoke to air bnb which I can post copies of their response that we have 5 rating something on their website had us getting declined without them understanding why. I have asked for their help to correct but only received apologies and less desirable rentals after over an hour of my time. At this point if they don’t make good on correcting I will never use them again for personal or business,1
"Unfair, Retaliatory, and Unreliable Company","After 8 years as a loyal Superhost with excellent reviews, Airbnb removed my account the very next day after I emailed their CEO about unfair practices.No warning.No proof.No appeal process.To make matters worse, Airbnb canceled all my guests’ confirmed bookings at the last minute, leaving travelers stranded with nowhere to stay. This is not only unfair to hosts but also deeply unfair to guests who trusted the platform.Airbnb claims to support “community,” but in reality, they bully hosts and abandon guests. If they can do this to an 8-year Superhost, they can do it to anyone.Avoid this platform — it is unsafe for both hosts and travelers.",1
I’m extremely disappointed with my…,"I’m extremely disappointed with my experience on Airbnb. It feels like the platform consistently prioritizes the host over the guest. Even when issues arise that clearly affect the guest’s stay, Airbnb seems quick to side with the host. In my case, the host left a false or unfair review, and instead of addressing it, Airbnb appeared to support them without proper investigation. Guests should feel protected and heard, but unfortunately, Airbnb seems more interested in defending hosts than ensuring a fair and safe experience for those booking. This bias makes me hesitant to use the platform again.",1
Me and my family have been attacked by…,Me and my family have been attacked by knife from one of the host just because he found that we are from Palestine and the host were from Israel !!!Our details weren’t confidential and I don’t know how host knew that! But anyway the Airbnb did nothing.I had to go back to London to sue them to get my money back,1
As host I am very satisfied with…,As host I am very satisfied with Airbnb. They are reputable and professional in handling all issues. Evenif customer service sometimes doesn't seem to be professional enough but once case is escalated to ambassadors it's being solved immediately,5
Bad customer service,"We were accused of breaking a table when we stayed with an Airbnb host, even though everything was in order when we left the apartment. The owner contacted us only a week later to say that the table was broken. We tried to appeal to Airbnb that we really didn't do it, but Airbnb didn't even look into the situation and just gave standard answers. It's a really bad feeling when you are accused of something you didn't do and have to pay $250 in compensation. I really didn't expect Airbnb to do this to us. Really very poor customer service.",1
Award for worst customer service”support”,"This isn’t my (or many people’s) frustrating customer “support” experience with Airbnb! If I could give a negative star every time, I would! I haven’t always written a review for lack of time but this time I am taking the time!Although the Airbnb customer “support” is non-existent” I have been on the platform as I had been at least fortunate to have multiple good hosts!This time unfortunately I had another misfortune of running into a terrible host, who had a terribly unhygienic room and much worse filthy shared bathroom where the other permanent /semi-permanent resident (as the host had mentioned his family might be in that room at times) would not flush the toilet properly every time and leave shaved hair all over the faucet that had to be hosed by me everytime before use!!The terribly dirty room with carpet of ages ago that was full of dust and wasn’t cleaned before arrival, corners full of dirt and dirt, magazine rack with musty mildewey magazines of 1900s!! and I was still patient to have him clean after I arrived… Finally I didn’t want to clean up the xxxx of the resident in the toilet and faucet everyday and I showed photos of all that to Airbnb and they pretty much grilled me for being patient to let the host address in vain and advised to leave right away and offered a refund for the rest of the days!!But the host in spite of sharing photos with both him and Airbnb of all the issues, wrote a retaliatory review for Airbnb enforcing the move, full of lies and aggressive innuendos accusing me that it is a lie (in spite of evidence that Airbnb saw) and me asking to have it cleaned as a “favor” etc. etc. and full of terrible passive aggressive language of innuendos and lies just to protect himself and ruined my perfect 5 star guest status!When mentioned that he is claiming all the evidence as lies and doing false accusations and defamatory language with euphemisms and asked for it to be removed, Airbnb said it is all within their policy that lying isn’t considered against their policy!!!!! in spite of the actual evidence!! Each one kept repeating the same thing like robots in spite of repeatedly you saw the photos, agreed and advised me to leave that place!!It is appalling that a greedy corporation is actually giving full permission for hosts to lie as much as they want (just like them) and there is absolutely no point having evidence in that case ironically the same photos based on which they asked me to leave such terrible place saying I didn’t have to be in such appalling place and the host isn’t responding to their messages as well!I was also told in the community center that the removal of any reviews is handled by AI now and having these addressed is pretty much impossible!!Then I got the same run-around for customer “support” as usual for days dodging this and being handed from one “team” to another until finally a “senior manager” comes up as usual with power to close everything! I also suggest customers never to go to a manager at Airbnb because they have the right to close any case and make things worse for you!Earlier one “manager” from the India team had told me that they cover everything in their legal and there’s no one in Airbnb who would help me (in my previous experience) and at that point I had to contact the exec team for refusing me a host approved refund of thousands of dollars!! So beware before having it escalated! Managers are the most corrupt on Airbnb and they can totally close your case without any consequences!!The only reason I have used Airbnb is for long term stays (due to unfortunate lack of competition although I have been trying to switch any time I have found other long-term options) and also due to many good hosts that are still there, so I request hosts to find other better options to put their listing on so the market isn’t monopolized.",1
Absolutely disgusted with the customer…,"Absolutely disgusted with the customer service from Airbnb, I unfortunately got scammed into buying £1500 worth of Airbnb vouchers. I completely take the full blame for this however, after being on numerous phone calls with different agents I was told that there was no way they could track the 6 vouchers to any bookings. How they're unable to look and track what accommodation has been booked with vouchers beyond me! I was also told by an agent that they could see from their end that 3 of the bookings were made by users who had used false booking information! Not only am I £1500 down, I'm extremely distraught by this whole experience and was hoping that I could come to Airbnb for some guidance. If they have no tracking system as to who's staying in people's properties, it's safe to say I will not be using them again.",1
Airbnb left me and my daughters on the…,"Airbnb left me and my daughters on the street at night in Jerusalem.Reseña:I booked 10 nights in Jerusalem with Airbnb. After a 20-hour trip with my two daughters, the host denied us entry and refused to let me use the building’s Wi-Fi to pay the required VAT. Instead, he sent an external payment link, which I felt was unsafe and outside Airbnb's policies.We ended up stranded on the street at night with our luggage and young children. Some Airbnb agents initially recognized this as unacceptable and suggested a refund, but the final decision contradicted that—“no rules were broken”—and the offer was only a 10% refund.This wasn’t a VAT dispute. It was a failure to ensure guest safety, trust, and basic human dignity. Airbnb’s resolution was inadequate and unacceptable.",1
Double Standard By Airbnb,"I accidentally booked a stay for September 7–12 instead of November 7–12.I realized the mistake within 30 minutes and immediately contacted Airbnb. Their own support agent cancelled the booking on my behalf and assured me over the phone that if the host refused a refund, Airbnb would refund me directly.Later, the host promised me in writing that they would refund my September booking if I made a new reservation for November. After that, however, the host changed their cancellation policy and refused to honor this promise.Airbnb then declined to support me, saying “refund is at host’s discretion,” even though I had clear written proof of the host’s initial agreement. They offered me a $200 coupon (on an $800 booking), then closed my case completely.This is extremely disappointing. Guests should not be punished for an honest mistake that was reported immediately. Changing the policy after the fact and refusing to honor written promises is a double standard.I will be pursuing this further with my bank and sharing my experience so that other travelers are warned. Be careful: if something goes wrong, you might lose your money even with written proof.",1
Business owners be careful,Business owners be careful. Be careful when you change an invoice to a new business address and VAT number. It doesn't get processed and they don't provide you with a new invoice. I accepted that in future it is better to book with another company when I need company expenses. They are completely not willing to help you.,1
Double dipping charges,"I had a horrible experience in an Airbnb in Streedagh, Sligo. I was charged very high fees, including high fees for 'cleaning'. The host went on to state that I should have cleaned his house, which wasn't that clean to begin with.I go to Sligo regularly to visit family. Thankfully, I have now done some research, and Booking.com offers much better prices and doesn't double dip with cleaning fees.I will definitely go with Booking.com next time.",1
Warning to Hosts,"Warning to Hosts: Airbnb Sides with Guests on Unverifiable Claims:I host a well-maintained, stylish home in a quiet area, with high standards for cleanliness and preparation. Recently, I’ve encountered guests who fabricate issues, such as odours, wet furniture, or noise -  after arrival, clearly aiming to cancel earlier than previously intended without penalty.Airbnb has consistently sided with these guests, issuing refunds without consulting me or allowing time to inspect the property - even within 24 hours of the complaint. Other hosts report similar experiences, and these tactics are becoming more frequent as Airbnb fail to deliver satisfactory guest experiences also.This has cost me + £2,000 in recent months. Airbnb’s handling of these cases undermines their stated host protections and encourages dishonest behaviour. In my view, it’s no longer a viable platform for reliable hosting.Their big problem in my opinion is a lack of customer support for hosts now and hosts of legitimate properties such as myself will take our properties elsewhere now as the business model is too rocky. Airbnb is too uncertain a service now.",1
The host always wins,"The host always wins. Falsely advertised property, given access to another occupied flat with personal belongings and deletion of messages. All that taken into account and I never ended up using the property, my review was removed, they were allowed to leave one for me. Air BnB have now asked me to put together a case to prove everything, no proactive checks themselves on deletion and changing of details. So poor, sticking to hotels from now on.",1
I am a host,"I am a host, and recently I have been battling with Airbnb to resolve a water damage claim against a guest. There is no hope for any resolution. Unfortunately, we as host are in the merci of God, to have a decent guest stay with us. There is ZERO financial reimbursement from Airbnb if the guest refuse to pay. My personal financial loss is greater than what I received from this guest. I opted for short lessee as I needed some extra income to support my daughters college fees. IT WAS NOT WORTH IT! Airbnb claims that the only act as agents and have no obligation to pick up the repair bill if the guest refuse to pay. I as a host have no say in drafting any T&Cs or request a deposit as a guarantee for any damage. So, the hosts are just putting themself in unlimited financial risk with no protection.The Airbnb customer support team are also so useless, They just read their scripted templates and do not understand the core of the complaint.",1
Booking cancelled and price raised,We booked a home for a 5 night stay in June of 2026. It seemed like the perfect place for our large group. We paid the full price upon booking and thought everything was set. A few days ago we got a message that our reservation had been canceled without any explanation. Included in the message was a list of comparable homes if we wished to rebook. Much to my surprise our original home was included in the list but at an almost $2000 price hike. We were originally told by Airbnb that it was canceled for our protection due to concerns about the host. The host told us that it was a “computer glitch” with pricing and we were charged the wrong amount. After much communication back and forth Airbnb aligned their story with the host and offered us no recourse other than our refund and $160 if we rebooked with them.I don’t understand how they can get away with changing prices after you have faithfully fulfilled your end of the contract. Apparently there are no protections from this kind of activity and people should be made aware of this upfront.,1
Airbnb processed multiple unauthorized…,"Airbnb processed multiple unauthorized charges on my credit card for reservations I did not make. Despite reporting the fraudulent charges, Airbnb refused to provide assistance unless compelled by subpoena.During this process, they falsely accused me of sharing my card information, which is untrue. Their refusal to cooperate caused significant stress, inconvenience, and wasted time.I urge Airbnb to:1.	Acknowledge that the charges were unauthorized.2.	Refund the full amount.3.	Implement policies to ensure consumers are not forced to obtain subpoenas to access basic transaction details.4.	Issue a public acknowledgment or apology for falsely accusing customers.",1
I would rate them a negative number if…,"I would rate them a negative number if possible. They do nothing as a company to help protect people from fraudsters and scammers. Their “special investigative team” is nothing more than a canned response about how there is nothing they can do. For this very reason I will never, ever use this unscrupulous company again. Absolutely disgusting company.",1

Airbnb no protect guest – £800 lost,"I’m extremely disappointed with Airbnb’s handling of my case.On April 9, 2025, I stayed in an apartment in Glasgow booked through Airbnb (Reservation code: HMQJPTR4WM). That same day, I realised I had left a bag with valuable personal belongings (worth approx. £800) in the apartment. I immediately contacted the host via Airbnb messages.The host acknowledged having the bag, even sent a photo of it, and promised to mail it back to me. Since I was no longer in Glasgow, we agreed he would send it via post.Over the next two weeks, he repeatedly told me he would send it ""soon"" — and then suddenly stopped replying altogether. The item was never returned.I reported the case to Airbnb, who escalated it to their insurance partner Crawford TPA. But in the end, nothing was done, and Airbnb took no responsibility, claiming it was “out of their hands.”The host still rents the same flat on Airbnb, despite this unacceptable behavior.Email from Crawford: case #25875038This was a serious failure in guest protection. I lost £800 and got silence from both Airbnb and their insurer. I can’t trust Airbnb anymore — not with my belongings, not with their “host standards,” and certainly not with guest support.",1
Terrible experience from the company…,Terrible experience from the company customer support. They are scammer and must be investigated,1
Disgusting behavior from one of your…,"Disgusting behavior from one of your hosts, on reading her reviews, this is not the first time. What’s worse AirBnB are enabling this extortion by supporting the host. I advice not to use Air BnN at all costs. Taking money out of user’s accounts for false damage claims is utterly unacceptable.",1
⚠️ Stay Away from Anna’s Property,"⚠️ Stay Away from Anna’s Property – 2527 Jane Street, Pittsburgh, PAI stayed at 2527 Jane Street, Pittsburgh, hosted by Anna, and it was one of the most disgusting and stressful experiences I’ve ever had.As a professional bodybuilder in town for a competition, I spent most of my time resting, cooking, and preparing meals. That’s when I saw it: mice running in broad daylight inside the house, darting from the piano area toward the heating system and into the kitchen. It was so unsettling I had to keep the lights on during the day just to get through the prep. Stress like that before stepping on stage can ruin performance — and it nearly did.If the rodents weren’t enough, the cookware was filthy, burned, and unusable. I had to go out of my way to buy my own pots and pans because hers were simply too nasty to cook with. For a property that charges full price, this is unacceptable.When I raised these issues privately, hoping to resolve it quietly, Anna didn’t apologize or offer to make things right. Instead, she became hostile, made false accusations, and refused to take responsibility.I’ve been using short-term rentals for nearly a decade without a single issue, and this was the first time I experienced something this bad. The house is unsanitary, and the host is unprofessional and defensive.Bottom line: Avoid Anna and avoid 2527 Jane Street, Pittsburgh at all costs. You do not want to deal with the stress, the rodents, or a host who refuses to take accountability.",1
Airbnb forces us to sleep on the…,"Airbnb forces us to sleep on the street! The host cancelled the booking in the last minutes prior to check-in time, for decent reasons, not his bad. Airbnb cannot offer a decent alternative (the closest one is 6 km far from the initial booking without even one review). They forces us to use the money we paid as credit on airbnb, but there is not even a close option to our initial booking  in any aspect for around the price scale I booked the initial place, and they do not attempt to pay for the only available option which is more expensive then our booking. When I asked them for refunding my money back to my bank account, they asked me to wait for at least 7 days. Yet, I have no other money to book a place via another platform to stay. The only thing they can do is telling me about their standard refund processing time, which is very very clever and customer friendly.",1
Complete scam - false advertising,Booked an apartment listed as 2 bed two bathroom that sleeps 5. Selected 1 guest as I wanted the property for myself (loser I know) - only to find out if you didn't book for 5 guests they just gave you a hotel room instead of the apartment. Refused my refund despite requesting it 20 mins after booking. When I complained they refused to answer my questions and closed my complaint,1
$1300 damage fee for dog toys that we found under bed and couch,They allowed a host to charge my family $1300 for damage and dog toys that was already there. We found the toys under a bed and the couch when we were cleaning! We don't even own a dog!!!!,1

Honestly I don't think I'd stay at another Airbnb again I think it's just too risky.The place I last stayed at was absolutely disgusting. But the customer service people went above and beyond to help me and I'm actually extremely impressed with them and their efforts.

False accusations and removal of review,"I left an honest, balanced review of a property.

I said no, but the pressure continued.When I reported this harassment with screenshots, Airbnb shockingly deleted my review and accused me of “pressure or coercion” instead of holding the host accountable. Guests deserve to know this happened.",1

I was forced to rebook at a hotel at my own expense. Out of $1,400, I was only refunded $200 because the host had a ‘strict no refund’ policy — even though the listing was falsely advertised and uninhabitable. Airbnb sided with the host instead of the guest, which was shocking. Be aware that Airbnb does not stand behind their customers when something goes wrong.”",1
They ignored the racism I faced,"I believe I suffered racial discrimination and some customer service lady on Airbnb wrote to me that they had looked into it internally and found there was no racism.What happened is that I was directed in Buenos Aires by the porter of the building I was supposed to stay in TO THE SERVICE ELEVATOR! And I am a black man. That took me to the correct floor and flat but wrong door and then my host claimed he fell asleep and wouldn’t open the door. I stayed for 4 hours talking to Airbnb call centre staff before I was finally transferred to a supervisor. When I finally left at 6am the same porter saw me and didn’t say a thing.This has NEVER happened with ANY of the other guests, none of whom are black.Airbnb have a non-discrimination policy but what use is it if there is no transparency in sharing the investigation and its findings and communicating them.They told me the host violated Airbnb guidelines by not communicating with me properly but chose to totally ignore the fact that the porter sent me to the SERVICE ELEVATOR at 2:30 AM!Black people staying in a flat in Palermo with a host, you have been warned!",1
We will never again rent with Airbnb,"We will never again rent with Airbnb.  We arrived at a property that was in terrible repair and dirty, nothing like the listing described.  I provided time stamped photos of the dirty bathroom, fridge filled with the leftovers from past renters, dirty and ripped outdoor furniture, etc.  We left the property and, after filing a complaint and talking to an offshore “customer service” person were offed a $22 refund for a $2000 booking.",1
What a scam for hosts and guests,What a scam for hosts and guests.  Hosts aren’t supported.  Guests are being scammed.  The customer service is a joke and an exercise in futility.  There are so many stellar short-term rental owners/host that are fleeing to set up direct booking sites.   Guests should follow them.  BEWARE!  It’s a cesspool!,1
After $50k Spent With Airbnb We Are Done Foreveroyal Airbnb customers…,"We have been loyal Airbnb customers spending close to $50,000 on stays the past couple years. one of our most recent experience in wilmington, nc was horrendous and showed us just how little Airbnb stands behind its guests.When we first got into the house we immediately contacted Airbnb about the problems. That did nothing. We were left with no real support and stuck staying in a property that was disgusting and completely misrepresented compared to the listing.There was service work being done inside the house without us being notified. I woke up with bed bug bites on my arm. There were stains all over the carpet. The kitchen was stocked with only three forks for the entire house. I could go on and on, but the point is this was not remotely what we paid for.Afterwards we left an honest review so other travelers could be warned. Somehow the host was able to have our review removed. So much for Airbnb’s promise of transparency and a trustworthy review system.The message is clear, as long as the host keeps generating revenue Airbnb does not care about the guest experience. Guests who tell the truth are silenced while the hosts continue operating without accountability.After years of loyalty and tens of thousands spent we are done. We will take our business and our money to companies that actually protect their customers.",1

I spent 6 hours on the phone to Airbnb through whatsapp, text and call for them to send me alternatives, often not even in the same country, I couldn't change dates or country as flights all booked for a party with 6 adults and 3 children.  They wouldn't advise why it was cancelled.The following morning I found that the original property was back available on an alternative site and contacted them, the owner contacted me to say he was told I cancelled? I re booked through the alternative (HOLIDU) and funnily it cost me £600 less,  we spent two weeks at the house, the owner was wonderful, house typical Majorcan style and quite lovely. will never trust airbnb again.  plus they kept my money for 11 months which would have earned around £360. in interest had it been in my account.  the other company wanted half on booking and the other half a week before arrival!",1

It appeared back in my account two days later. I give them 5 stars for their efficiency, staff and ease of doing business. Would have no hesitation in booking with them in the future.",5
Inaccurate property description,"The description of the property was inaccurate. We were expecting a pier and ocean view, instead we got a dirty window view and zero privacy if curtains were left open. Essentially, we had a unit where we could just keep the windows curtains closed always. AirBnb support team had no ability to provide any support other than Host response. Essentially, AirBnb has no policies in place to protect the consumer if Host makes an error. I am not surprised to see rest of the reviews are so poor.",1
This is only the beginning,"This is only the beginning. Airbnb stole over $247 USD from me. I had an account under my legal name, linked to my verified bank account and Visa card. Yet, Airbnb deactivated my account at the exact moment of my reservation, leaving me unable to access the property. Because of this, I was also blocked from emailing them for support.When I called, they offered no real help. As a result, I was stranded in Guatemala with my two daughters, completely abandoned by the company I had trusted.Airbnb has still not refunded my money. I am now filing police reports and preparing to sue. I will also be going public—because no parent should ever have to watch their children suffer due to the negligence of a corporation with the resources to resolve such issues instantly.Case No: A70420788",1
Looking for a total scam?,"Where to begin?Upon arrival, the fridge was broken. With children and groceries already done (all wasted of course), we asked for a solution. Instead, endless promises: “30 minutes… tomorrow you’ll move…” — pure lies, until the holiday was over.Nothing fixed. The place was disgraceful: dirt everywhere, dog excrement left in the pool for days, broken amenities, even dangerous stair railings hanging loose, a real risk of falling from the 3th floor. Kids could have died. Total hazard.Other guests confirmed similar issues, so it’s systemic.Airbnb support? A joke: a ridiculous refund and case closed. This is not just bad service, it’s deception. Absolutely unacceptable.Avoid both this Host (Zzzing)  and Airbnb, they are a total scam.We’re done with them for good, UNACCEPTABLE!",1

Unsafe water and no good follow up,"We've had some good stays, but when it's bad it's bad. We stayed at a place with mouse poop on a bed, unsafe brown drinking water that was not disclosed to us prior to the stay, and broken items. When we asked for a small refund, the host ghosted us and wrote a review that we left the place ""messy and in need of a deep clean"" when it was already not cleaned well to begin with. And our review was taken down, with no indication that Air BnB will follow up with the hosts to require they can't rent it with unsafe water or at least need to disclose. The experience of trying to follow up on the issues was worse than the stay, and not worth it for the good stays.",2
AirBnB is as expensive as hotels,"AirBnB is as expensive as hotels, full of scams, poor hosts who lie about amenities, and generally are far worse than the hotel experience. I've experienced everything from having to purchase my own toilet paper, to being harassed by other guests, to being spied on by hosts. You are forced to clean for cheapskate hosts who then beg for 5 stars. Horrible experience all the way around and I will never use the service again",1
Zero,"Zero, Zero rating deserved.They sit behind a screen, don't help.Airbnb’s handling of hosts is extremely poor. Today I had a guest who claimed they could not remove a key from the door. Within hours Airbnb cancelled the reservation and charged me, despite the fact that the guest later managed to get the key working. The booking remains cancelled, I lose the income, and yet I am still charged.This is a door that has been in use for over two years without any problem. Two other people used the exact same lock today without issue. Yet I am the one penalised because a guest couldn’t operate a basic lock.Airbnb’s response shows no fairness, no logic, and no support for hosts who do everything right. They appear more interested in taking money than providing a reliable, ethical service. Their approach is both morally and ethically incompetent.",1
Stay away from Airbnb,"Stay away from Airbnb - they do not care  about guests using their platform & will always side with their hosts whenever there is an issue arising - be it personal, or financial - in conclusion, they are more interested in keeping their hosts happy on their platform, then in the rights and personal protection of guests using their platform",1
Scammers paradise,"Having used airbnb for over 10 years, hosts have now started asking for off platform money once you have booked. This is a SCAM.

Support is non existant for the user.,"Support is non existant for the user.We rented a place in Sardinia, and when we arrived it was not what was advertised. It was tagged waterfront and ""entire"" home. Yet there was one house split into multiple entrances separated by an internal doors in the hallway of the original home. You could hear everything echoing through from the family next door, and we were there 5 minutes before we declined. By the way the waterfront was 15 minutes from the home. When raising this with airbnb support to start the refund process, the host offered a partial refund through support and later declined, and set the cancellation date 2 days after check in date which is when we declined.AIRBNB have all this evidence in the chats in tehre own app but will not enforce the host to do the right thing by the refund policy.

During my time working at Airbnb, all employees were assured they would receive a travel credit. Every one of my colleagues received theirs—except me.Despite reaching out multiple times to managers and the internal team, I was met only with delays and no resolution for months. I even contacted Airbnb Support, but instead of helping, they repeatedly closed my case without my consent or any explanation.Sadly, I eventually had to leave my role without ever receiving the credit I was promised. This entire experience has left me feeling let down and unsupported by a company I once worked for and believed in.I expected better from Airbnb, both as a former employee and as someone who trusted the company’s values. I truly hope Airbnb takes accountability and ensures no one else has to go through the same experience.",1
Constant rejection “unauthorised party”,"Have tried multiple times to book an Airbnb, ranging from apartments to houses. My partner has also tried and also had their booking rejected.Airbnb constantly accuses us of planning an “unauthorised party”, and even though the host is fully willing to have us stay, they are also powerless.Apparent risk factors include age and time of booking. I am 31, and I have tried to book places well advance and even on the day of to no avail. Also tried booking for a group of two and group of 8 but both attempts again rejected. This has rendered Airbnb unusable and I will no longer consider it in the future. Its AI architecture must be losing it a lot of business.I followed procedure and contacted them for help but the staff on the phone also have their hands tied and escalate it to someone else, who never end up being able to lift the restriction.I’m sure Airbnb will reply with a copy and paste response of security safety etc but the bottom line of the matter is that there is a flaw with their booking system which unfairly penalises people on their age. We’re not all party people, I just want to enjoy a holiday!",1

That was resolved.Separately, the host falsely claimed I damaged a bathroom outlet that was already damaged. Despite my evidence and appeal, Airbnb denied it and has charged me $610.98 for this so-called “damage.”I did not cause this damage. Guests should not be held responsible for pre-existing conditions. Airbnb needs to stop shifting host liabilities onto guests.",1
I have been a host for 8 years with a…,"I have been a host for 8 years with a consistent 5-star record. Recently, a guest caused several hundred dollars in damages to my home. Airbnb failed to cover even half of the damages and took almost a month to “review” the case — I still haven’t been paid.To make matters worse, the same guest who vandalized my house had the gall to post a retaliatory 1-star review. I flagged it immediately, yet Airbnb support was delayed and unresponsive. Despite clear evidence, they allowed the review to remain live long enough causing real harm to my listing.Airbnb’s so-called “customer support” is little more than a call center with no authority. Every interaction ends with the same empty promise to “escalate your request,” but nothing happens. It is an endless waste of time.Airbnb takes a hefty cut from every booking, but offers no real protection to hosts. The company has shifted the entire risk to its hosts, while leaving us vulnerable to abuse, property damage, and bad-faith reviews.If you are considering hosting, know this: when things go wrong, you will be on your own.",1

Later, I received a closure message from Hamza saying the coupon was cancelled but I would NOT receive the refund either. This is misleading and unacceptable.After calling again, another advisor reactivated the coupon, but I never got the promised cash refund.I feel I was misled by Airbnb support, given false promises, and left without the proper refund. This is extremely unprofessional and disappointing.",1

Unjustifiable $100 Airbnb Service Fee – Even When Host Agreed to Full Refund,"Update | 01sep2025I canceled a reservation with Airbnb due to a legitimate work emergency. My host generously refunded 85% of the reservation. Airbnb, however, refused to return a nearly $100 “service fee”, despite providing zero support or involvement in the refund.I’m a 12-year Airbnb user. They provided no service, no credit, no flexibility, and no goodwill. I filed a BBB complaint—Airbnb dismissed it. I offered to accept even a credit, but they refused. They claim the service fee covers “platform use,” but when nothing is provided and the host handles the entire refund, it’s hard to justify.This feels like a scam. Be warned: Airbnb keeps your money—even when your host doesn’t. If you cancel, you lose money—even if nothing is booked, no keys exchanged, no help given, no support provided.I have filed complaints with the FTC and State Attorney General. Airbnb is failing its customers with rigid policies that ignore reason and fairness.========================================================================Title: Unjustifiable $100 Airbnb Service Fee – Even When Host Agreed to Full RefundDespite my host generously offering to refund 85% of my reservation due to an unavoidable work emergency, Airbnb refused to refund the nearly $100 “service fee”—even though no actual service was rendered.Airbnb claims the fee covers platform use, support, and booking protections, but in this case:•	I canceled well in advance•	The host handled everything directly and fairly•	Airbnb support contributed nothing to the resolutionCharging a substantial service fee under these circumstances is unethical. It’s essentially a penalty for having to cancel—despite a fully cooperative host and no usage of Airbnb’s services.I contacted support and asked for a one-time exception as a show of good faith and guest care. The request was flatly denied.This experience is deeply disappointing, and I will be filing a formal complaint with the Better Business Bureau. I encourage others to read the fine print and be aware that Airbnb keeps your money—even when your host doesn’t.",1
"Host in Tournefort, France – discrimination complaint ignored, negative review censored","We stayed at a property in Tournefort, France (July 12–17, 2025), hosted by Dréane Wladimir. What happened to us — and how Airbnb handled it — is something travelers should know.⸻🚩 Our experience with the host:1.	Unreasonable check-in – After a 12-hour drive, we requested a quick check-in. The host insisted on a 30-minute property tour, dismissing our exhaustion.2.	Sexually suggestive conduct – The host engaged in inappropriate poses, including bending over and crawling upstairs on all fours, wiggling her buttocks in front of me. She repeatedly stood too close despite my efforts to keep distance.3.	Disrespectful behavior – She shouted foul language in French as she left, then returned uninvited into our private conversation.4.	Hostility and intimidation – That evening, we overheard a 15-minute aggressive argument between the host and her partner, adding to the feeling of unease.5.	Derogatory messages – She later sent insulting messages, calling me a “weirdo,” and accused me of inappropriate behavior.6.	Privacy violations – She announced she would perform daily property checks, even after we objected, later saying she would only come when our car was gone — making us feel monitored.7.	Inflexibility and pressure – Before arrival, despite warning her about possible delays, she demanded arrival by 7:30 PM, forcing us to leave Stuttgart at 5 AM.8.	Potential retaliation – She offered massage services, and after we declined, her treatment of us became colder and more hostile.We documented these issues in a formal discrimination complaint to Airbnb on August 18, 2025, including explicit details of inappropriate physical proximity, suggestive conduct, aggressive language, and derogatory remarks. Airbnb dismissed the case without informing us of any outcome; the host continues to operate as normal.⸻📝 My original Airbnb review (removed by Airbnb):“We feel compelled to share our concerns about our recent stay. After a 12-hour drive, we requested a brief check-in due to exhaustion, but the 30-minute rundown felt dismissive. Your suggestive behavior, including close proximity and provocative poses, made us very uncomfortable, despite our efforts to maintain distance. Your loud, insulting remarks in French as you left were upsetting. We also overheard a loud argument with your companion, which was unsettling. The daily property checks, even after we raised privacy concerns, felt intrusive, as you noted checking when our car was absent. Your inflexibility regarding our late arrival, despite prior notice due to road issues, added stress, forcing a 05:00 early departure. Lastly, your final message accusing me of acting strangely and calling me a ‘weirdo’ was unwarranted.”Airbnb reinstated this review after my first appeal, but then removed it again two days later, stating it was “irrelevant.”⸻📢 Host’s review of me (still public):“A very intimidating attitude, I greeted him with a smile. He had a very aggressive face, as if he was very, very angry. I think it was inappropriate in front of a woman. I tried to relax things a little by talking but there was nothing to do. Then I showed him how the facilities worked. He continued to act very strangely. It was very disturbing. I tried to communicate with him but either he turned his back on me or he went in another direction. I’ve never been so uncomfortable, he wasn’t acting normally. In 6 years of being a Superhost on Airbnb, I’ve never seen this.”Despite my discrimination complaint and formal requests, Airbnb has allowed this review — filled with insulting, subjective, and gender-based remarks — to remain public.⸻⚖️ Airbnb’s handling:•	My negative review was removed twice (first for being “retaliatory,” later as “irrelevant”).•	The host’s insulting review of me remains public.•	My formal discrimination complaint was dismissed, with no explanation or accountability.•	The host still enjoys 129 perfect 5-star reviews, which is unusual and does not reflect our experience.⸻🚨 Why I am posting this publiclyBecause Airbnb erased my honest review but preserved the host’s insulting one, I feel future guests are not being given the full picture. Guests deserve transparency. Airbnb’s system, in this case, silenced the victim and protected the host.Travelers, please be cautious: the glossy 5-star reviews do not always tell the full story.",1

"Airbnb “Expert” with $3M+ Earned—Yet Delivered Mold, Lies, and Industrial Noise","BrookeBNB in San Diego promotes herself as an “Airbnb expert” with $3M+ earned on Instagram (@brookimonster), but my experience was anything but expert. I booked her listing for a professional work trip and left within 29 hours due to unsafe, unsanitary conditions and blatant misrepresentation. The address was hidden, placing me across from a bottle-crushing facility that ran all night—zero sleep, nonstop industrial noise. The unit had black mold, rusted vents, broken fixtures, and a shower with near-zero water pressure. The balcony didn’t exist.She falsely claimed I stayed three nights and misrepresented the rate I paid. Airbnb refunded only $400 of $1,443.63 and closed the case without investigating. Their support was robotic and dismissive, ignoring health risks and the disruption to my work trip. I’ve filed formal complaints with the California Attorney General and San Diego County Consumer Protection.If this is what $3M+ in hosting looks like, it’s a warning—not a badge of honor.",1

Airbnb removed my Superhost Status after 11 years,We have been SuperHosts for 11 years straight. This year due to a correction in the address listing we lost visibility and did not have enough bookings. Now they have taken away our SuperHost status even if our reviews speak of our dedication.

No loyalty to dedicated hosts.,1
Unsafe apartment allowed for rental,"Our rented apartment was not renovated according to legal norms. There was a dangerous step between the sleeping room and the salon where my daughter hurt herself several times, and I almost, too. The place was not well described, not suitable for a family or for longer stays (we booked for 14 days). The service-orientation of the host was zero. I posted a factual, detailed review on AirBNB. It was removed a few days later, claiming that it did not follow their rules. I read the rules and could not find any violation of it. Bottom line, Airbnb is not trustworthy, has no values and does not care about the safety of renters. We will not use their site anymore, especially because there are better options available out there.",1

Unfair Treatment and Mishandling by Airbnb Ireland UC,"I am an African host who had previously maintained a perfect 5-star record on Airbnb. Unfortunately, one guest (reservation HM3RFDSXN9, Chakim from the UK) violated multiple rules: he brought more guests than allowed, damaged my property (wardrobe door, chair), and left the apartment in an unsanitary condition.When I requested reimbursement for damages, the guest refused and immediately left a retaliatory 1-star review, which dropped my rating from 5.0 to 4.33. I submitted full evidence to Airbnb (photos, cleaning reports, proof of extra guests).Airbnb’s handling of my case was deeply disappointing:They confused my file with another host’s case, referring to a different guest name.One of their agents closed my case without informing me.They falsely claimed I had already spoken to a “specialized team” and received a solution, which never happened.Despite repeated requests, they refused to provide a case-specific written report or explain which policy sections applied. Instead, they replied with generic scripts and finally closed my case, saying their “hands are tied.”This is not only unfair but shows a lack of transparency. As an African host, I cannot avoid the impression that my evidence was disregarded while my UK guest’s position was prioritized.I have now filed formal complaints with the Irish Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) regarding misrepresentation, lack of transparency, and unequal treatment.Airbnb markets itself as a platform of “trust and safety,” but my experience proves that when a host faces retaliatory behavior, Airbnb fails to protect us.Hosts, be cautious: even with evidence, you may not be treated fairly.",1

I have been using AirBnB for a long…,"I have been using AirBnB for a long time. I do enjoy the service. But there are things that, as a business, are unforgivable and easily fixable from their end. I have let them know that several times, and after years, we still have to deal with the same issue; hence, I am rating a 1-star.If I pay via PayPal, the money is instantly in AirBnBs account. I always pay from my Balance, not a credit card. Now, I know that if I refund customers via PayPal, they immediately get a PayPal notification.  So, that alone tells me that you don't even process the refund straight away.I don't care what you do, but when you take a large sum of my money and then have some issues verifying an account that we've been using for over 10 years, and therefore my booking request expires, then you need to find a solution that enables me to book the original or another. You see, not everyone has that same large sum available to make another booking, i.e., they need that money back ASAP.We have been in this same situation several times now over the 10+ years we have been using you. You cockup somehow, or your service provider, but you leave us hanging.  It's unacceptable.Your little henchman on the phone who get paid peanuts, hence, they have no knowledge, and are capable of doing nothing. But if you had some people with a brain, it would be like ""Oh, look, our system has issues because we did away with the Facebook log in; Let's expedite this ID verification; or let's delay this ID verification because we are dealing with a 10-year-old account"". But no, as I said, there is no brain activity there, because that's what you pay for.Super disappointed, and I'm looking at using alternative services now.",1
AirBNB Townhouse in Ewa is a LIE,"Listed as ""Townhouse in Ewa, Beautiful and Spacious. 4 beds. Sleeps 8""  Is a lie.  We had 7 people and there is literally two queen and two twin beds, they claim there is a 'floor mattress' but there is a piece of foam rubber that isn't a mattress nor even the size of a bed.  Needless to say there was no space for the 7th person even with us doubling up uncomfortably.  Air BNB refused to do anything about this lie.  Owner is able to block negative reviews.  Ruined the vacation.",1
Why won’t you let me give Airbnb 0…,"Why won’t you let me give Airbnb 0 stars???While our condo stay was excellent, my experience with Airbnb as a company was extremely disappointing. The listing was misleading in its pricing — Airbnb displayed a nightly rate of $647 with no separate cleaning fee, while the host’s actual rate was $428/night plus a $140 cleaning fee. That’s about a $700 difference hidden in the way Airbnb structures and presents costs.When I raised the issue, Airbnb repeatedly deflected, closed my case prematurely, and offered only a $150 coupon for a future booking, which felt insulting rather than helpful. Transparency is key, and Airbnb failed to provide it. If these fees and markups were displayed openly, I doubt many customers would accept them — which is precisely why they are not disclosed up front.This was supposed to be a special trip for my mother-in-law’s 75th birthday, and instead, the process left us feeling deceived and dismissed. While the property itself was wonderful, I will not be using Airbnb again. I’ll be booking through VRBO or directly with property managers in the future.",1

Awful experience,Awful experience. They cancelled my booking on the day of my holiday and would not give me a reason why (I know it was air bnb who cancelled it and not my host). They then promised to refund my money and provide a refund for up to 3 nights in a hotel at $325 per night per room (up to 2 rooms). I was then able to book the same complex but via the main provider and not air bnb. They said they would only refund me if i could show an invoice. I sent them the booking confirmation which they said i couldnt use because it was an invoice (even though it had on all the information they needed). So i then obtained an invoice in the exact format they requested. They still refused it and questioned if it was valid or not (implying that i was lying). i then proved this by sharing the email with them from the accommodation and they accepted it was a legit document (they didn't apologise for calling me a liar though!). Now their next attempt to get out of paying (even though everything was as they asked on  the invoice). They have been the worst company i have ever had to deal with and i will now be using them again. Cancelled the holiday and then try to wriggle out of paying a refund making it so difficult on purpose. Awful.,1
Cancelled my booking 3 weeks before I travelled!!! Totally inadequate resolution!,"Airbnb cancelled my booking just three weeks before my holiday, stating the apartment listing I had booked was under investigation due to feedback. They offered alternative options they claimed were “equivalent”, but these were roughly 40 minutes away from where we had originally chosen to stay, lacked the number of bedrooms we originally booked, and didn’t have the same amenities — completely unsuitable and not of the same standard.Since the trip was so close, prices for similar accommodation in the same area had more than doubled. I spent an entire weekend going back and forth with Airbnb, asking if they would cover the difference so we weren’t left out of pocket by hundreds of pounds. They refused, offering only a 20% coupon, which didn’t come close to covering the additional cost.This experience has completely put me, my friends, and others I’ve spoken to off using Airbnb again. Their policy left us without a place to stay and and has forced us to spend significantly more to salvage our holiday — all due to a cancellation that wasn’t our fault. This has caused an inordinate amount of stress ahead of our trip. The customer service team did what they could but management clearly don't care! Luckily, Booking.com has been much more reliable. Be wary of this unacceptable approach to cancellations when booking with Airbnb!",1

Airbnb Upholds FAlse Reviews Even When Guests Provide Evidence,"I've been a verified member since 2019, traveling often in the US and overseas, with a spotless record until one host left a false nitpicking review. Despite photos proving I left no trash, the host spelled my name wrong, on top of wanting me to vacuum his unit and take the trash 'out' in a condo-hotel setting, and gave more irrelevant complaints, Airbnb's 'support' sided with the host and told me there was nothing they could do. If this is how loyal guests are treated, then Airbnb has lost me as a customer. I'll be taking my business to platforms that value fairness and accountability",1
Unfair treatment and poor dispute resolution – no wonder Airbnb has 1.3 stars,"I recently had a very disappointing experience with Airbnb that has left me feeling completely let down as a guest.We stayed at a pet-friendly listing and made the host aware in advance that we were bringing small, crate-trained dogs. Unfortunately, during the day while we were upstairs, one of the dogs had a small accident on the bed. We immediately cleaned it thoroughly using supplies provided and were transparent with the host at checkout.Despite our honesty, the host submitted a claim for £120 to replace the duvet, later ""reducing"" it to £80 without explanation. I pointed out that:The dogs were crated overnight (with timestamped photographic evidence),The listing had no house rules prohibiting dogs from being upstairs at the time,The host did not dispute any of the facts when we messaged her directly,The cost was excessive — dry cleaning or a standard replacement would reasonably be under £30.Airbnb ignored all of this and sided with the host. They didn’t address the inconsistencies in her claim or respond to the evidence I submitted. They claimed to be ""neutral,"" yet failed to engage with the clear facts or acknowledge that the host escalated the claim without any justification.I was penalised for being honest, when I could have easily just dry cleaned the item for a fraction of the cost and said nothing.This entire process has felt one-sided and unfair. The lack of transparency, inconsistent standards, and complete disregard for reason is staggering.Given this experience, it’s sadly no surprise that Airbnb has a 1.3 rating on Trustpilot. If this is how they treat guests, I’ll be using alternative platforms going forward — and I’ve already warned others to do the same.",1

Unable to deal with issues fairly due to subservience to their 'processes'.,"Writing as a host I have concerns re Air BnB's ability to deal with issues fairly.A guest left me a glowing review, a message saying they had a great time and wanted to return, but only a 3 star overall rating.  I haven't been open long, so one 3 star review in amongst the other 5 star reviews has made a dent in my overall rating, and that matters when you are a small BnB at the very bottom end of the BnB price range.The guest promised to change or delete it, but they didn't. I contacted Air BnB and they sent me a link that they told me the guest could use to delete the review. I sent it to the guest. The guest said that they would do it but a week later nothing had happened.I used Air BnB's review appeal process twice to try and get the rating removed but they refused both times, and then said that as I had used up my permitted two attempts they couldn't do anything further. In between these attempts I telephone them and the person I spoke to assured me that if I requested it deleted again it would be done, but it wasn't.Mean time the guest got back to me saying that the followed the link I sent them and they have looked and looked but couldn't see any way to delete the review.I called Air BnB again, and this time they said that the guest needed to sent them a message asking/authorising them to delete the review - which they could, and should, have told me the first time I contacted them (i'm not sure what the link that they sent me was for).But my issue with them is this... Air BnB's policies and blurb goes on endlessly about the importance of accurate and fair reviews and how the whole system works on the trust of these reviews. In this case no one was claiming that the 3 stars were fair. Air BnB could see my conversation with the guest, they could see that the guest was saying it was a mistake, but they still refused to delete it... so fair reviews are apparently not that important to them after all.I have ME and I have recently reopened, having had to give up my paid job through illness. So the BnB income, although small, is everything to me. This makes me feel lousy every day, but stress, emotional and mental etc, cause me to crash and get much sicker. Each time I have to spend an hour on the phone to Air BnB it causes a crash. So this stuff matters.It's disappointing as previously I have found their customer support people quite helpful, but this time they seem to be at the mercy of their 'processes' and there are no ways to correct mistakes.",2
Dont expect any help from Airbnb just bla bla bla,"I doubt that this company can improve. Here is my experience. I wish to file a complaint against Airbnb.I was with Airbnb 12 years. My overall rating was 4.53. The highest is 5.About 2-3 months ago I received a notification from them stating at they would remove both of my listings by the end of August.  I was shocked and contacted them immediately to lodge an appeal and to request more details. They then sent 4 booking references without explaining the details, i.e who complained and what the complaint was. They clained that they send me an explanatory email but I never received this. I told them I might have deleted this by mistake but they would not listen and said their decision was final. I tried to contact them again but they then cut off telephone access. I want to say that Airbnb always believes the guests never the hosts so if a host makes up a story eg cockroaches in the room, they will believe him/her. Here is what they sent me:This is the latest from them.  And these are reservations HMCMQXBNS5 , HM88P2AQWM, HM98ZQKKXF, HMJWFDFFFS and I had also informed you that you had not appealed for your listing suspension communicated with our Specialized team on time and the time has passed out, and they had upheld with decision as this listing "" Tropical paradise- Super Friendly 2 "" will be deactivated on dated 29th AugustMy complaint is totally unfair and biased treatment.Thank youLorraine J ElletsonID X2724589D",1

This is the worst customer service…,"This is the worst customer service experience I’ve ever had with any company. Airbnb offers zero solutions and hides behind rigid, nonsensical processes that fail to resolve even the simplest issues — reinstating a reservation that was mistakenly canceled.On top of that, they expect customers to be constantly available for their support team, and to answer in no time, which is both unrealistic and so far from how you work in the hospitality domain, especially considering how useless their support actually is.It’s extremely disappointing to see how they treat customers now. A few years ago, their customer service was responsive, human, and genuinely helpful. Such a shame for a company of this size to treat its customers this way.",1
Prioritising profits over guest safety,"I had a deeply troubling experience during a recent Airbnb stay. The host was not fully transparent about key aspects of the apartment. After encountering several issues, I requested a partial refund and the host declined, as refunds are at the host’s discretion.More concerning was that the host attempted to enter the apartment without any permission or prior warning, a serious invasion of privacy. I reported this to Airbnb, but they did not deem it a violation of their policies, despite this clearly breaching basic standards of guest safety.Another violation was the host offered me a monetary incentive in exchange for a 5-star review. I reported that as well.I then left a factual, objective review outlining these issues, but Airbnb removed it, stating it was 'retaliatory' as I mentioned that the host declined a partial refund. I suspect that anything you leave in a negative review could be deemed so by Airbnb. This reveals a worrying trend: Airbnb silences honest feedback while protecting hosts who generate income for the platform.This lack of transparency and accountability makes it impossible for future guests to make informed decisions. Reviews should exist to foster trust, ensure safety, and reflect real experiences, and not be filtered to protect revenue.Airbnb appears more concerned with protecting its brand and host income than enforcing its own policies or safeguarding its guests. That completely undermines the integrity of the platform.A company should be judged not just by its policies, but by how it upholds them when issues arise. Airbnb has failed to do that, and has left guests in vulnerable positions with no recourse or protection.I will not use Airbnb again.",1
"Airbnb Failed Again—No Safety, No Accountability, No Dignity","As usual, Airbnb doesn’t protect guests. It abandons them.Here is its latest nonsensical twist: When a host lies about an alleged discrimination, leaving out details about its part in provoking the whole matter , Airbnb doesn’t investigate. They don’t ask for context. They don’t care about truth. They just deactivate your account and move on—no dialogue, no due process, no dignity. PS: I’m still trying to figure out, exactly how does a guest discriminate against a host? I suspect that even Airbnb doesn’t know, just falsely and recklessly throwing around descriptors without a proper context or meaning. I mean, did I somehow withhold something from the host, for a particular reason or favor one host over the next? I know it sounds crazy.Airbnb now strikes again given that in the recent past it demonstrated blatantly that its operation is more about policy—than it’s about safety. Airbnb sends travelers into foreign environments with zero preparation for even the most basic sanitary realities. In some countries, (Philippines) guests are expected to discard used toilet paper in open trash bins rather than flush it. No warning. No guidance. Just weeks of breathing in the fumes of soiled tissue in a sealed room, because Airbnb couldn’t be bothered to flag the health risks or cultural expectations.That’s not just unsanitary—it’s negligent!Airbnb’s support channels are performative. Their policies are rigid to the point of cruelty. And their so-called “community standards” are weaponized against guests who dare to speak up.I wasn’t just mistreated—I was erased. If it think I’m going to remain silent, Airbnb has  got the wrong one.Travelers deserve platforms that prioritize truth, safety, and dignity. Airbnb isn’t one of them. If you’re a traveler who values truth, fairness, and respect, look elsewhere—Airbnb has lost the plot.",1
Do they even care?,"Trying to report a 'host' on Air BnB is absolutely frustrating.

"Airbnb’s Review System Is Broken and Protects Hosts, Not Guests","I had a recent experience with Airbnb that makes me question the integrity of its review system and its commitment to protecting guests.We stayed with a Superhost who claimed to have hosted over 400 guests in 8+ years. Yet, when I checked, she had only 95 reviews, almost all suspiciously glowing. When we left an honest review describing our negative experience, I noticed that Airbnb did not display it at the top (even though it was the most recent) but buried it far below older reviews. This makes the review system misleading and unreliable for future users.Worse, the host responded to our review with defamatory statements, discriminatory remarks, and even disclosed our private information. We reported this to Airbnb support. Shockingly, they told us the only way to remove the host’s malicious response was if we deleted our own honest review. In other words: the host’s harmful, rule-violating content is allowed to stay, but only at the cost of silencing the guest.This shows Airbnb is not committed to transparency or guest safety. Instead, it seems more interested in protecting Superhosts and maximizing bookings rather than maintaining a trustworthy review system. Guests rely on honest reviews to make safe decisions, but Airbnb’s practices deprive them of that right.Airbnb is failing at its core responsibility: providing a fair, safe, and transparent platform. If they cannot protect guests or uphold their own review policies, how can travelers trust this product at all?",1
I am honestly really disappointed,"I am honestly really disappointed. Airbnb seems to protect hosts, not guests. The whole system feels unfair and ridiculous they can reject your booking simply by looking at your profile.",1

They allowed the host to cancel our booking just 6 weeks before travel. At that point the prices had doubled for similar properties. New booking was made to only to be canceled an hour later by the host as it was advertised in error! AirBnb has serious policy flaws and all they could offer me was a pathetic £80 credit towards my next booking. Not allowing me to get a full refund of the £550 charged on my credit card, as I wanted to take my money back and book with Booking.com at that point. I was forced to book with them again - a small hotel room for the same price! I logged a formal complaint via their website, and to date (2 months later) I have heard nothing back. They are a disgrace of a company.",1
Misleading Advertising and Failure to  Disclose Important Information by the Host,"I booked the Casa Sun accommodation in Puerto Del Carmen, for the period 3 - 8 August based on the description advertised on the Air BnB platform. The host, MR Lanzarote failed to disclose important information, information that affected my  ability as a consumer to make an informed decision. The description of the property advertised it that it is in a calm location providing peace and quiet for guests. Unfortunately, the host didn't disclose that there is a construction site opposite the property so the advertised description is misleading. There was constant noise from morning to night every day of my stay. The noise was from electrical tools which also created dust, e.g. angle grinding work was just one example of some of the noise endured. I have video evidence of the noise as well. The outside space of the property couldn't be enjoyed and windows in the property could not be opened. The issue was raised with the host, MR LanzaroteVillas but they dismissed the problem, stating that ""neighbourhood noise"" is out of their control. The host was certainly aware that the construction site might cause issues as another guest review on a different advertising platform mentions the construction site! That review is dated early June 2025. It's a pity I hadn't seen it before I booked this property and I'd have known that I wouldn't get what the host advertised and what I paid  for i.e. calm, peace and quiet. What I got was loud construction noise from morning to night fir 5 days. The construction is far from completed and so noise is likely to be a feature at this property for another number of months. MR LanzaroteVillas stopped replying to my messages seeking compensation for misleading advertising and a ruined holiday.",1
Pulling my listing from Airbnb. Management does not support the Host no matter how bad the 'guest',"After listing my beach cottage, I have rarely been so upset by such sheer lack of reasoning by management and all staff, frequently repeating its 'policy', when it's clearly not. After having guest who was a con artist, literally crawling under the bed to take close up of a bit of fur friendly) and video of an ant crawling, then showing 'proof' my place was dirty and infested, which it wasn't, airbnb saw fit to give the con artist 'guest' free stay.  The guest got to stay for a few night free at the beach house, free wifi, free beds, free showers, free washer/dryer, free utilities, free fireplace, etc.  The guest was unbelievable, but airbnb allowing it, was actually shocking.  I had proof how nice, clean, and a couple ants, is not infested, but airbnb kept calling it that, even if at the beach!",1
I was placed in a property involved in prostitution — Airbnb refused to take responsibility,"I booked a property in Ho Chi Minh City through Airbnb, only to find out after check-in that the unit was located above a suspected brothel. There were men constantly coming in and out, speaking loudly in Chinese, and the ground floor had signs that clearly suggested illegal activity (in Chinese language, which I could read). I felt extremely unsafe as a solo female traveler.I immediately reported the situation to Airbnb with photo and video evidence, yet Airbnb refused to acknowledge the nature of the issue, stating only that the host denied it. They offered no meaningful support, no relocation, and no refund.Airbnb claims to ensure guest safety, but in reality they ignore serious safety concerns when they involve illegal or inappropriate activity — especially in countries like Vietnam where such operations may go unchecked.This is not just a bad listing — it’s a serious security and legal concern, and Airbnb should be held accountable for allowing such properties to remain on the platform.",1
I’ve been a loyal Airbnb user,"I’ve been a loyal Airbnb user, but this was by far my worst experience.The property was advertised as “luxury living,” but what I arrived to after an 11-hour flight was extremely disappointing: stained and matted carpets, damaged furniture, grease build-up in the kitchen, dirty and chipped surfaces, grime in the bathroom, and ripped communal loungers. The BBQ listed was there, but dirty, rusty, and unusable. To make matters worse, I found a cockroach inside the property. I documented everything with photos.I contacted the host right away, who pushed me off to a property manager. Instead of offering a resolution, they only suggested coming by the next morning to “inspect,” even though the place was clearly unfit to stay in that night.Airbnb support was even worse. I was verbally told I’d be refunded, but no one would give me confirmation in writing. I was passed between different agents repeating the same lines, waiting on callbacks that never came. The only time I saw actual movement on my case was when I said I would file a chargeback — not as an empty threat, but because Airbnb were ignoring me.Meanwhile, the host tried to pressure me into cancelling the booking myself (which would have been a trap, as it shifts responsibility onto the guest). They also tried to extort me for the first night’s fee plus a cleaning fee, simply because Airbnb failed to act quickly and the issue spilled into the next day.All of this was happening while I had already spent over $6,000 on this booking. Airbnb’s solution? Refunds that take up to 10 working days to process, and a “contribution” of $200 toward alternative accommodation — nowhere near enough to cover the cost of rebooking last-minute in LA. They offered no financial help in the moment, leaving me to cover hotel costs out of pocket.This was stressful, exhausting, and completely unworthy of the trust I placed in Airbnb. My advice to anyone in a similar situation: document everything with photos, never cancel the booking yourself, and if Airbnb drags their feet, threaten a chargeback — unfortunately, that was the only thing that got them to act.",1
"Host cancelled, Airbnb rewrote the truth","I booked an Airbnb because the listing clearly stated “Free parking on premises.” Before a 7-hour drive, I politely asked the host to confirm this. Instead of reassurance, I received contradictions (sometimes “on premises,” sometimes “street parking,” sometimes “if other guests don’t use it”). When I explained that certainty was important, the host escalated into hostility, writing “Excuse me,” “this is not your commercial hotel,” “you are not welcome,” and “we don’t need or want your money.”Airbnb initially recorded this as a host cancellation, which would have allowed me to leave a review and warned future guests. Then it was quietly reclassified as “Airbnb cancelled.” That change erased the host’s accountability, blocked my ability to review, and misled future guests.Airbnb talks about trust and transparency, yet their system shields hosts who misrepresent listings and mistreat guests, while silencing those of us who pay in good faith. If a host can advertise amenities they don’t guarantee, behave abusively when questioned, and still be protected by Airbnb, then this platform is not safe for consumers.",1

My stay was deeply disappointing due to multiple safety and cleanliness issues, including broken blinds, sticky surfaces, large couch stains, and a loud AC that disrupted sleep. The deadbolt near the garage failed one night, and as two women traveling alone, we felt unsafe. The host was unresponsive for hours, and the lock was never fixed during our stay.We later discovered that the unit(along with the hosts other listings) are not legally permitted to operate as a short-term rental, violating local ordinances. Despite these serious concerns, Airbnb refused to issue a full refund and removed our honest review under false pretenses. We were also blocked from messaging the host, preventing resolution.I believe this listing should never have been available on Airbnb and that the platform failed to protect consumers in more ones than one to include removing my negative review to protect the host's ratings on the platform.",1
I recently booked a cabin in Norway for…,"I recently booked a cabin in Norway for my family, including a child and a guest with a disability. Upon arrival, we found used condoms under the carpet, rubbish, and stained bed linens and blankets. These serious hygiene and safety issues made the cabin unsuitable and stressful, ruining the start of our holiday.Despite reporting the problems, the host did not offer to clean or replace the stained linens, and instead tried to shift blame onto us. Parking and access issues further complicated the stay, especially for our disabled guest.I reached out to Airbnb for support. While they offered a partial refund for only the first night, the issues persisted throughout our stay, and I was advised to leave the property rather than being fully supported as a guest.I am disappointed with Airbnb’s handling of this situation. Families traveling with young children and guests with disabilities should expect safe, clean accommodations and proper support, and situations like this could harm Airbnb’s reputation if not addressed properly. I hope Airbnb takes stronger action to ensure guest safety and satisfaction in the future.",1

Gift Card debacle,"I have been a faithful AirBnb user for a few years with great reviews as a renter. This last booking just put me out on AirBnb. I booked a unit for 6 nights at $1200. Great price. Then, the fees added on an extra $700. So, after the initial down payment, I had finally built up enough rewards to purchase 2 AirBnb gift cards. I read all of the dos and don'ts about gift cards. I thought I had a handle on it, but it seems not. I added the first gift card under the PAY NOW, which is the only way it would take the credit. That worked but when I tried to add the second, it showed the whole remaining balance was paid. I never got to add the second gift card. I called support and nothing they could do. There has to be a way to add multiple gift cards after you have made a payment. What a waste.",2

Unsafe experience and no real support – Case A67429424,"I booked an Airbnb stay where the host demanded my passport outside the Airbnb platform. This felt unsafe and is against Airbnb’s own policies. There was also manipulation from the host’s side.I reported this multiple times to Airbnb and clearly explained that this was a Trust & Safety issue, not about cancellation policies. Despite that, Airbnb closed my case (A67429424) only citing the host’s cancellation policy, without addressing the safety concerns at all.I have since filed complaints with ECC Netherlands, FTAC Curaçao, and the Ombudsman Curaçao, and also informed my bank (ING). It is disappointing that Airbnb fails to take responsibility for guest safety and privacy.Airbnb should treat Trust & Safety complaints with the seriousness they deserve, instead of dismissing them under “cancellation policy.”",1
Last-minute cancellation without compensation – legal steps initiated,"On August 12, 2025, my Airbnb booking was cancelled on the very day of arrival. Instead of providing an equivalent accommodation at the booked location, Airbnb only offered a lower-quality place in another city. In addition, a replacement accommodation I booked myself was also cancelled at the last minute.While the refunds were processed, Airbnb refuses to provide any compensation for the significant inconvenience, extra costs, and stress caused. I have already contacted the European Consumer Centre and sent a formal complaint to Airbnb Ireland UC. Further legal steps are underway.A simple refund is not enough in such cases – Airbnb should take responsibility for the consequences of last-minute cancellations.",1
Airbnb Exposed Us to Bedbugs & Abandoned Us,"Airbnb We suffered a severe bedbug infestation at an Airbnb, with painful rashes and contaminated luggage.

Generous turned out to be 20% which is a joke.The communication from their side was not clear and they made it look like they would cover the whole night. Funny enough they actually never sent the money, and when asked, a rep just said they will not compensate anything. This even if they promised.After tens of messages they did send something as refund but the milk is already sour. I will not use then again and recommend also this apporach to everyone.",1
Unfair Treatment by Airbnb: False Review Stands Despite Our Video Proof,"We, a group of families traveling with babies and infants, booked a stay through Airbnb. When we arrived, the place was not properly cleaned from the previous tenant — there was even a sanitary pad with blood left in the washroom. The landlord insisted that we clean the place ourselves, which we did to the best of our ability considering our young children.Despite this, the landlord left a false and defamatory negative review accusing us of not cleaning properly. We submitted a formal complaint to Airbnb requesting the removal of this unjust review, providing extensive evidence including a 20-minute video clearly showing the condition of the property before and after our cleaning efforts.To our shock, Airbnb dismissed our complaint in less than 20 minutes without properly reviewing or even watching the videos we submitted. This shows a concerning lack of fairness and transparency in how Airbnb handles review disputes.False negative reviews like this can seriously damage guests’ reputations unjustly, and when evidence is ignored, it undermines trust in Airbnb’s review process. As families traveling with babies and infants, we found this treatment especially distressing.We expected much better accountability and responsiveness from a global platform. If you are traveling with young children, be cautious — even strong evidence may not guarantee fair treatment by Airbnb’s review moderation system.We are now taking steps to escalate this complaint to Swedish consumer authorities and European consumer protection bodies because Airbnb has failed to properly address our case.",1

"Unsafe Property, No Refund, and a Company in Decline","I’ve been an Airbnb guest for over a decade. In that time, I tolerated the occasional misrepresentation, but this recent experience crossed a line.I booked a property in La Jolla for $5,400 (four nights). Upon arrival, we found deck railings rusted and coming loose over a steep cliff, plus an interior in deteriorated condition. Clearly unsafe and not as advertised. We reported this immediately.Airbnb first promised resolution “within the hour,” but after 4.5 hours of silence their official response was that the host would paint the railings tomorrow and offer us a discount if we stayed. Painting over a structural hazard the next day is not a remedy. We had already vacated for safety.Airbnb’s “senior case manager” later denied the refund altogether, dismissing the hazard as “wear and tear.” The company’s own policy claims to protect guests in cases of safety hazards or misrepresentation, but in practice it failed completely.After more than ten years of trust, this showed me the company no longer prioritizes guest safety, fairness, or retention. Looking at Airbnb’s 1.3 Trustpilot rating and daily new 1-star reviews, it’s clear my experience is not unique.Airbnb is financially strong and busy expanding into new services, but it seems to have abandoned the basics: delivering safe, honest accommodations and standing behind its own guarantees.",1
Airbnb is a disaster,"Airbnb is a disaster. We had booked an apartment in Tel Aviv, only to arrive and be told by the host at the last minute that the place was unavailable due to “plumbing issues.” We were left standing in the street with our luggage and absolutely no solution from Airbnb.Customer service is non-existent: hours on the phone, endless promises of call-backs that never came, different agents every time, and zero actual support. Their only “solution”? Cancel the booking and issue a refund that takes 5–10 days to appear—forcing us to pay again out of pocket just to find somewhere to stay.Because Airbnb would not respond, we had to book a new apartment ourselves on their platform. Only after we informed them that we had already booked did they suddenly say they “could have offered a coupon covering the full stay.” In other words: they stayed silent while we were stranded, and the moment we resolved it on our own, they told us it was too late and that now they “couldn’t do anything.” They refused to cover the new booking, offering only the refund of the original one.We lost two full days of our trip dealing with this nightmare, spent far more money than planned, and received zero real assistance.Airbnb claims to provide security for travelers, but in reality they abandon you when things go wrong and hide behind excuses. Avoid this platform at all costs if you don’t want to risk going through the same ordeal.",1
Airbnb’s Dark Side,"Airbnb’s Dark Side: My Experience With Threats, Theft, and SilenceIn April 2025, my girlfriend rented an apartment in Paris via an Airbnb-listed agency called Pickaflat. What followed was a nightmare.The agency forced her out, threatened her, illegally entered the property against police warnings, and even stole some of her belongings. I witnessed the entire incident firsthand.Naturally, we expected Airbnb to step in, protect the guest, and take action against such blatant misconduct. Instead, Airbnb did the opposite:They ignored clear evidence of criminal behavior.They seemed to shield the agency rather than the victim.And when I protested, Airbnb’s response was to cancel my account entirely.So not only was I pulled into a criminal case — I was also silenced and punished by the very platform that facilitated the abuse.Having spent over 30 years in investment banking and hospitality, and as the owner of several establishments across Europe, I have worked with countless property owners who currently list on Airbnb. After this experience, I am considering encouraging them to rethink their partnership with a platform that protects revenues over ethics and covers up criminal acts.Airbnb brands itself as a “trusted community.” My story shows otherwise: when things go wrong, victims are abandoned, silenced, and erased.This is not just a bad customer service story. It is about a global company choosing profit over integrity — with devastating consequences for its users.",1

Disappointing Support Experience – Lost €300+ in Fees for a website Mistake,"I had a frustrating experience with Airbnb that left me both disappointed and discouraged as a new user. While comparing two properties, I accidentally booked the wrong one. I immediately canceled, and the host kindly approved a 90% refund.However, Airbnb kept over €300+ in service fees, even though I made the correct booking right after—and paid the full Airbnb fees again. I contacted support and spent nearly 4 hours explaining everything, only to receive vague responses and no real help. If the policy is “no refund on service fees,” they could have told me from the beginning instead of wasting my time.This was only my second booking on Airbnb, and sadly, it’s already a negative experience. I expected better transparency and support from a platform of this size. I’ll be sharing my experience across other platforms too—people should know what to expect.",1

Airbnb Canceled My Paid-in-Full Booking and Left Me Stranded,"I booked a 5-bedroom house in Bruck, Austria through Airbnb in March 2025 for a February 2026 reunion. I paid the full amount at booking. In August 2025, the host canceled.Airbnb’s ‘solutions’ were not comparable: smaller homes, or 1.5+ hours away. They offered to apply my payment plus a small $72 credit, and later a coupon (20%, then 50%). I sent Airbnb links to real comparable rentals — even agreed to downgrade to 4 bedrooms/1 bath — but was told they were ‘too expensive.’After multiple calls, I was given until 8/12/25 at 9:38 PM to decide. Instead, Airbnb closed my case on 8/11, rescinded the coupon, and refunded me against my wishes. Since then I’ve been completely ghosted.

This is insulting given the scale of their failure and the legal duties they have under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and their own Guest Refund Policy.Airbnb sold me a holiday, cancelled it without remedy, left me stranded, and now refuses to cover my actual loss. This is not just poor service — it’s a breach of consumer law.My advice: if you value your holiday, money, and peace of mind, do not trust Airbnb.",1
Miss selling by Airbnb…,"Booked a family holiday in Cyprus August 2025 to stay at an apartment which looked stunning. Upon arrival in Cyprus ( Larnaca Airport ) we were informed by the car hire company that the apartment is actually in the North of the island in a territory unrecognised by the international community controlled by Turkey. As such we could not take the hire car there as it would not be insured, no taxi would take us and as such at 1am in the morning with three children we found ourselves stranded at Larnaca airport. Further researched revealed that they’re may be issues crossing the boarder ( controlled by Turkey ) for foreign nationals as well as returning to the south. The apartment was adversities as Cyprus, and not an internationally unrecognised zone controlled by Turkey. This is obviously not advertised by the host of the apartment on their listing and despite being aware that we were coming from the UK failed to mention this. Due to the issues we were unable to stay at the apartment and had to find alternative accommodation in the republic of Cyprus at additional cost. When returning to the UK Airbnb have refused to refund our money stating  that there is a map of the island of Cyprus on the hosts listing which in their mind mitigates any responsibility for any territorial or political issues etc that may exist in any country you visit. Airbnb and the host have both miss sold and miss represented the listing and refuse to refund only offering us £147 back if the £751 we spent on the apartment.",1
Unhygienic property,"Unhygienic property, no real help, unacceptable “compensation”We arrived at our Airbnb booking only to find the property had not been cleaned at all. The bedsheets were dirty, bins and the dishwasher were full, there was food left in the fridge, food on the floor, and even unflushed toilets. It was completely unfit to stay in, especially with children.I contacted Airbnb immediately. While there was a suitable alternative property available nearby, Airbnb chose not to offer it to us because it was £300 more expensive. Instead of honouring their responsibility to provide a safe, clean alternative when a host fails, they left us stranded. This is a clear violation of consumer protection policy.With no hotels available and unwilling to pay £300 out of pocket for another booking, we had no choice but to drive home late at night. This caused immense stress, extra costs in travel and wasted time for my whole family.Airbnb has since offered me less than half of the additional cost it would have taken to rebook us properly. Their so-called “compensation” does not cover the fuel wasted, meals while waiting, or the disruption of a ruined trip.After seven years as a loyal customer, I’ve now deleted the Airbnb app and will no longer use their services. Fortunately there are many more booking platforms across England, and I’ll be pursuing those in the future.

We went through the appeals process and were mistreated throughout.  We requested that the host anchor the dresser and TV to ensure it would not be unsafe for other families.  They ignored our request, so we left a review on their site to warn other families.  They removed the review.  I hope no one else gets injured due to Airbnb's negligence.

No matter what I say or what proof I show, airbnb keeps acting as if they don't understand, and keep telling me to repeat myself, pretending that they didn't hear, or that there's no photos, not even the ones from the host. Look at the photos of the host, there's no damage shown. Airbnb keeps asking ""do you have photos"". It got extremely irritating and airbnb was just constantly concerned with closing my request. Very negative experience. Now I have to worry about airbnb stealing money from my credit card behind my back simply because they arbitrarily decided I should give money to someone making false claims. I think airbnb just wants money from people, doesn't matter who, how or why. When I tried to tell airbnb about an abusive host, they didn't care. Because I extended my stay with the host behind airbnb's back, so it was ""outside their policy"". Doesn't matter if the same host keeps hosting on airbnb. The host can be as abusive as they want with anyone who isn't at that moment paying through airbnb. Tells you a lot about their character. All I was asking was to be able to post a review.

This means Airbnb knowingly protects offenders and leaves hosts exposed to danger, financial loss, and liability.Airbnb operates like a criminal enterprise: they profit while sending unchecked and potentially dangerous strangers into private homes.My advice: Do not risk your property or your family’s safety with Airbnb. Choose platforms or agencies that provide real protection and accountability. Airbnb only creates problems and puts you in danger.",1

Do not expect help from airbnb support and do not go to Varna Heart Studio,I had very bad experience in my Airbnb location in varna and i did not get any help from Airbnb instead they put me on speaker and laugh at my frustration.We went to our airbnb appartment which was on the last floor and the air conditioner did not work. There was also only one small window that we can open and no elavator. We have to leave the studio at 11:10 p.m pm when i finally found somewhere to stay with my mom(76 years old with heart problems) and my daughter (6 years old). Instead to help me they have sabotage me to find another place thinking probably that we will stay there if we do not find  a place to stay. The owner sent a technician who entered the appartement while we were in front of the building but our luggage was inside without having our permission to go in. At the end i was so exhausted and frustrated they put me on speaker and start laughing at me and my frustration.It is not first time when an airbnb location does not have air conditioner or actually it has but it does not work and it is very hot outside and inside as well. They make also impossible for me to make a review. So i am done with using airbnb.,1
Worst support ever,"Worst support ever. Even as a Superhost, when you call about an issue with a guest — including security concerns — they will just keep calling you back without actually resolving anything. Even if you send all the justifications, they will keep changing the support person one after another, but never bring a real solution.They drain your time and energy, and you should not expect any reasonable resolution. This is the worst application I’ve ever seen — quick to take their commission, but the last to care about customer service.

The host never replied, the request expired, yet my money was already taken. This is not pre-authorisation — it’s an immediate charge for a service not yet provided, which feels both unacceptable and legally questionable.Customer service was unhelpful and inconsistent: the chat went in circles, phone support barely spoke English, and only after insisting on escalation did I get a call back. The explanation? “It’s our policy” — and I’d have to wait up to 15 business days (potentially three weeks) for a refund.Such practices are dodgy, not trustworthy, and certainly not customer-focused. The travel spirit Airbnb once had is gone — replaced by a company that seems more interested in holding on to customers’ money than in providing fair, transparent service.",1
Ecxeeding my highest expectations,I had to cancel a reservation the day of the check-in for a very serious weather alert in an asiatic country. The host was very kind but Airbnb went even above my expectations in assisting me. Year after year I found that the announcements became very clear and the quality of houses with good reviews is high and consistent in any country. It’s definitely the best way to stay in a genuine and nice location while travelling,5
I would give them 0 stars if I could,I would give them 0 stars if I could.The host added bogus charges and every time there’s something new. If you’re renting out your property expect people to use it. If you want rules followed don’t add them to your listing afterwards and make up lies!,1

"The property was run down, depressing and in a hostile neighbourhood","The property we viewed on AirBnB looked good but when we turned up my children wanted to leave immediately. The neighbourhood in Dar es Salaam was clearly not frequented by foreigners so people stared at us as we arrived and went to the apartment. The property was so depressing that we immediately informed the host that we were leaving. We had to then find another place to stay at the last minute. AirBnB said they'd help us cancel but we weren't able to cancel, apparently, and we lost three night's accommodation costs.",1
"Booked a Stay, Left With a False Damage Bill","Stayed at an Airbnb with broken AC, bad bathroom odour, cockroaches, and no mirror provided. After check-out, host claimed I damaged an old, dusty sofa and a “missing standing mirror” that was never there.Disappointing and stressful experience.The property had several issues:•	Air conditioner was not working properly.•	Bathroom had a constant unpleasant odour.•	Small cockroaches appeared during the stay.•	No mirror was provided in the first place.After check-out, the host claimed I damaged an old, dusty sofa and a “missing standing mirror” that was never present in the unit. The host’s initial claim was MYR 1,139.00, later reduced to MYR 991.95, but still completely unjustified.I provided evidence, but Airbnb still processed the claim against me. This experience has left me very disappointed in Airbnb’s dispute resolution process, and I will be much more cautious about booking with them in the futureArte Plus, Ampang Kuala Lumpur.",1
Violation of safety,"On a one-month trip to Greece, two separate Airbnb stays were unsafe. In Chalkida, the washing machine had to be daisy-chained to a waist-high outlet, creating a trip hazard, while multiple outlets had exposed wires; drainage caused health issues and the host ignored us for over 9 days. Hoping for relief, we booked Kalabaka, where an unknown person entered through the front door while I was undressed; even after 48 hours and a police report, the host with security cameras gave no answer. Airbnb’s Safety Team dismissed our case, never refunded us, and both listings remain active.",1

"Airbnb refuses refund Host “Balaji” in Hua Hin, Thailand","Airbnb refuses refund — Host “Balaji” in Hua Hin, Thailand** Review:**I booked a stay listed by host Balaji in Hua Hin, Thailand, paying €900 for a property I never used. I felt unsafe traveling to the area and notified Airbnb immediately, requesting a refund for a service that was not provided.Yet Airbnb refused, siding with the host’s strict cancellation policy. They closed the case without giving me a chance to respond. This is a concerning and unfair situation: I lost €900 without ever entering the property.Key facts:17 contact attempts to Airbnb support — case remains closed.Host operates multiple listings in Hua Hin (Bright, Modern Pool Villas near the beach) that share the same profile visuals and style.I will proceed with formal chargeback and public complaints unless resolved.Warning: If you value guest safety and fair treatment, beware — Airbnb may back the host and withhold your payment even when service cannot be delivered due to safety concerns.",1
Air B N B Services Is Very Difficult To Work With,"As a new host for Air B N B services, the process to get approved has been excruciatingly frustrating.  I own a brick and mortar spa that is rated 5 stars on Google and has been open 5 years.  In May 2025, I submitted my business to Airbnb services. Since then I have received first AI generated information saying that I had to change the listing. They gave me very little information about what needed to be changed. After making the edits and submitting them it took nearly 2 months to get the edits approved. In fact, I am still waiting for the approval process. I’ve had to have meetings with their associates, and even after that meeting and asking for them to not include my personal name in the listing they still provided me back copy 10 days later of my personal name included in the listing. I’ve explained to them several times that it should not take three months to get a listing approved. it is ironic that it is so easy for a host to put up a property and they barely verify it, yet you have to go through scrutinizing approval to get an Airbnb services listing. At this time, I would not recommend other businesses to work with Airbnb services because it will take so much of your time and resources, and they will continue to leave you in the dark about what is happening. If you’re listing finally gets approved, it could take over 90 days to do so. And then, of course I don’t even know what to expect once the listing is approved. I have been asking if there is a Supervisor for me to provide feedback with and there is no supervisor available. So far it looks like Airbnb services is a great idea, but they are too disorganized and overloaded to be able to actually make it work out.",2
I’ve had the unfortunate experience of…,"I’ve had the unfortunate experience of dealing with the airb&b customer service after a recent booking.  I’ve got to say they have THE worst service I’ve dealt with, we’ve booked 3 airb&b trips, the first two we had no issues so didn’t have to involve airb&b, the third however had a lot of issues!  Things were broken (2 of 3 showers, hot tub), the owners dogs trying to attack ours, the pool was freezing and the patio around the pool damaged and unsafe to top the trip off the owner is trying to charge us for damage we know nothing about.  Not to worry I thought, this can all be sorted out by customer services, ha ha ha not a chance.  My claim was rejected, no reason why just rejected, case closed with no chance of responding.  The owners claim has been approved and changes on a daily basis, both for what’s damaged and the amounts, it’s ranging from £32 to £195, £211 and now £405, we have a saying in the uk you couldn’t organise a p1ss up in a brewery, something that describes their customer service team perfectly as airb&b couldn’t arrange due to their incompetence.  While I have air in my lungs I will never book with airb&b again and I would warn others from doing so as well, it’s ok when it goes smoothly, it’s stressful and genuinely painful when it doesn’t.  Special shout out to Max and Uzma, both as useless as each other.",1
"Stay WELL clear, pun intended :-) :-)","Extremely poor experience, host decided to increase the cost simply because the wind was blowing from the west. They had the gaul to request more money via What’s App. I complained to AirBnb and they upheld the hosts right to increase the costs ! I duly asked to cancel and have my deposit back, well that was like pulling teeth. I had to threaten them with a PayPal dispute, they finally gave in, although they were so condescending when I ‘tried’ to escalate it as a complaint and basically said we were glad we could help you today and then ‘hung up’. Appalling company. It is surely run out of a back street garage !",1
"🚨 Airbnb protects scammers, not guests. 🚨","A woman in Manhattan was falsely accused of causing $16,000 in damages. The host submitted fake, AI-generated photos… and Airbnb believed them. Without investigating, they ordered her to pay $7,000.She provided evidence, a witness—nothing changed. Until The Guardian published the story. Only then did Airbnb refund $5,700 and remove the bad review. The scammer’s “punishment”? A simple warning. He’s still hosting today, ready to fake evidence against the next guest.I just canceled my own 15-day stay in Gran Canaria. I will not give my money to a company that chooses to protect a scammer over its customers.⚠️ Share this. People need to know that on Airbnb, if a host accuses you with fake photos, your only hope is finding a journalist willing to tell your story.",1
"Extremely Disappointed – Misleading Listing, Poor Support, and Unresolved Issues","I want to share a review reflecting my disappointing experience with Airbnb due to poor support and unresolved issues with my accommodation. The room I was given was completely different from the listing—photos were misleading, and the space was dirty, old, with unclean walls and bathroom. Despite reporting these issues, I received very little support from the customer service, which responded slowly. After reporting the false advertisement, I was asked by the host to move out, and customer services didn't provide alternative accommodation. Only a fraction of my money was refunded. It appears this listing has been falsely advertising for a long time, which is unacceptable.This kind of behaviour should be penalised, and customers need to raise awareness and report such misconduct. Unfortunately, many are deterred from complaining because Airbnb’s response often discourages genuine resolution, leading to unprofessional service. Over time, I’ve noticed prices on this platform keep increasing, yet the standards of service for guests have not improved—this is disappointing and needs to change. Platforms like Airbnb need to ensure accuracy in listings and offer guests proper support when things go wrong. Based on this experience, I will no longer use this site for my stays and encourage others to be safe and use hotels as a better option, offering quality and reliable service.",1
Beware of Scammer guests using Airbnb to expoit Hosts,"I have been a highly rated Airbnb host for years, maintaining a spotless record and consistently meeting Airbnb’s hosting standards. My experience with a guest named Frieda, however, revealed a serious flaw in Airbnb’s policies that allows dishonest guests to exploit hosts.Frieda booked a one-week stay starting 27 July 2025. She was informed well in advance that another guest would also be present, as the listing clearly stated. She arrived several hours late without notice or apology. Within hours of arrival, she began making completely unfounded allegations — including false claims about the property’s cleanliness — despite the flat being thoroughly cleaned with dated photo evidence. She even fabricated extreme statements to create the impression of being unsafe.It quickly became apparent this was not a genuine complaint but an attempt to obtain money in exchange for retracting or softening her review. This kind of conduct violates multiple sections of Airbnb’s review and extortion policies, which prohibit using reviews to pressure hosts for refunds. Yet the system allowed her defamatory statements to remain published and when i tried to get this defamatory review removed, Airbnb said there was nothing they could do.The review she left is not only false but abusive and personally damaging, causing moral and financial distress . Airbnb’s current enforcement process fails to protect hosts from guests who weaponise the review system to secure unearned refunds.I would strongly caution any host about accepting a booking from this guest named Frieda.More broadly, I urge Airbnb to take a stronger stance in enforcing its own policies against dishonest, abusive guests who exploit the review process for personal gain.",1
People need to know from other renters…,"People need to know from other renters the negative they experienced.   No one should come into a rental where the air quality is not clean, fresh. Such as chemical cleaning products. Some people do not want to enhale chemicals. Also, I rented a place that was 3 feet from the house next to it. These people had 15 cats inside, the stench outside was disgusting and the fleas and bugs everywhere.  You has to walk by that going into the rental. The stench was smelled inside the rental. This should be known BEFORE you commit.  Bad business to silent the truth.  The negative should be posted.",1
Their only interest is your money,Looking at the growing number of complaints I’m not alone. My advice go direct with a landlord as soon as possible once you discover a good one! I stayed in a place that had a completely different description. It was dirty with loads broken. But the worse thing was the heat and noise. Sometimes I’d be up until 3am waiting for the neighbours to go to sleep. Whist sat in 30 degree heat. Air bnb did nothing. Despite photos and proof. They sided with the host and made me wait the remaining 30 days. Then after that I left a review based on all my proof. The host then left me a bad review as retaliation. Airbnb refused to remove it despite the host clearly lying. I told them I would delete my profile and go direct as it’s a disgrace to treat people like this. And that’s exactly what I’m doing.All they want is your money. Avoid Airbnb.,1
Airbnb is fine when all goes to plan,"Airbnb is fine when all goes to plan. I recently arrived at a destination only to find it impossible to gain access using a key lock. The host was uncontactable and their customer service was appalling, it looked like we would be left to sleep rough but eventually found a hotel who charged the earth, they drag their heels on refunds and only offer a fraction of the additional costs. They do not have a process to find safe accommodation when their hosts don’t deliver. Hotels are a far better option and would only use them again as a last resort",1
"As a host, anyone can post negative reviews","If you're a host and you get a 1 star review which goes against AirBnB's own policies, they will not remove it.It looks like AirBnB is annoying guests and hosts - better management needs to be put in place.",1

Agritourism in Dosso del Liro: filthy and unsuitable — Airbnb refunded me 1/4,"I stayed at an agritourism in Dosso del Liro, Italy (Lake Como) called ""La Fonte di Mariella"", which many (mostly foreign tourists) had rated five stars — it looked like a nice, well-kept place from the photos.Inside the apartment we found spiders, dust, cobwebs, dead insects on the walls and floor, a live scorpion under the fridge, a greasy, encrusted oven (clearly not cleaned recently), a kitchen missing basic items, and a tiny bathroom with no bidet or washing machine that flooded just from taking a shower.The internet connection was unstable, and the access roads were full of steep hairpin turns just to get to the nearest town.We left the morning after the check-in because it was impossible to have a peaceful, decent holiday — and impossible to work remotely with that internet.Only after repeated requests from me, and despite having sent photos and detailed evidence, Airbnb refunded me ONE QUARTER of the cost as a “courtesy” (€180 — basically just covered gas and tolls).Their “specialized” support team told me in chat that they are literally “just a third-party advertising platform” and that disputes between host and guest have to be resolved between them.Funny, because in reality Airbnb is an intermediary that takes COMMISSIONS on every stay.From their replies, it seems to me they only care about that last part (the money): when a customer has a problem, they’re left ON THEIR OWN, as I was, and handed a “courtesy” tip to make them stop complaining.Had I known, I would NEVER have booked through this platform — I’d have chosen a more reliable one that actually protects customers from abuses that happen ON THEIR platform. I certainly won’t use Airbnb again or recommend it to friends.As for me, I wasted time and money on the only vacation I managed to plan this year — and all I got from Airbnb were apologies and a tip. Draw your own conclusions.",1
Airbnb Allows Unethical Operator,"Airbnb warns: “Be careful when communicating with Hosts outside of Airbnb, and never send money.” Yet they allow Ckg Property Group Ltd to operate while encouraging off-platform bookings, exposing guests to serious risk.The listing falsely claims the flat is “close to Wembley Stadium” — it’s actually over 30 minutes away by public transport. Properties are often unclean and poorly maintained, and the operator has a track record of unpaid rent and broken agreements with landlords.Airbnb must enforce its own policies. Guests and landlords, be cautious.",1
AirBNB is a nasty company - and they owe me a refund!,"AirBNB is a nasty company.They allowed me to purchase their gift cards (using credit card points), and then when I went to use them on a reservation, they did a background check on me and decided to delete my account.Fine, if they think a felony from 30 years ago is reason to not have me as a customer, that's their business. But now they won't refund my $350 worth of gift cards that I can't use.Maybe they should've done their background check before they took my money! And shouldn't I be made aware that they do background checks? I would've never wasted my time.",1
FRAUD.. using someone's else address on a listing,"I have no business with AIRBNB whatsoever. I found out through The city where I live that my residence has been identified as a short term rental on airbnb. and they sent me screenshots of the listing showing pics of the rental. The pictures are not even my house. so I followed up with the City regarding this mistake to be told as long as my address is tied to a listing, I'm responsible of any fees , charges, or violations for not registering my house. With further digging, I found out that a neighbor across the street does airbnb and the pics on the notice I received are exactly from his house . SO CLEAR FRAUD! I contacted airbnb many many times and I got nothing from them. they keep saying that a special team is investigating the issue and will get back to me. I contacted them online, on the phone and on twitter and still no results. One agent carelessly suggested for me to go to the house I think it's the real listing and ask the resident to remove my address!! Like I'm going to approach a scammer who is committing a fraud and face him with his crime!!!! Unbelievable! The last straw is filing a police report to cover my back and ask them to compare my house inside and out with the pics from the listing.",1
Last minute cancellation,"The day that me and my friends are catching our flight to our Airbnb place in Croatia, the owner cancelled because she thought the house was already removed from the site, but it wasn’t. We were left in distress because we didn’t have a house and immediately booked a new, overpriced house without a pool like our previous house. (Which was really hard to find since there are so many scammers on Airbnb!!!!) Then we call Airbnb (which is really hard to reach, you only can chat with a damn ai bot) and they can offer us barely any compensation. We were never given any and had to pay 177 euros per person more.",1
Worst experience ever.....,Worst experience ever...... They hire the worst customer service people and they don't really care about their customers. They cheated me out of a $25 re-booking credit after a host cancelled my reservation the day before I was to show up.

I was charged for allegedly damaging a…,"I was charged for allegedly damaging a set of towels, which I strongly dispute. The damage was caused by disinfectant that had been poured into the shower drain before my stay. When I took a bath, the chemical came back up, making the floor slippery. Without realizing it, I must have transferred the residue to the floor rug and towels while drying myself. My own clothing was also damaged in the process.Despite explaining this, Airbnb took the host’s side without properly listening to my explanation or considering the evidence. I felt unfairly treated and unsupported as a guest. Because of this experience, I will no longer use Airbnb and will look for alternative platforms.",1
I stayed at an Airbnb hosted by LUXVART…,"I stayed at an Airbnb hosted by LUXVART in Tulum from July 23–27. While the property itself was beautiful and the initial experience smooth, the host’s behavior afterward was deeply unprofessional and unsettling.I had hired their recommended chef on July 25 and paid that same day. Unfortunately, my phone was damaged and out of service until July 30, so I missed follow-up messages. Without giving me the chance to explain, LUXVART sent a threatening message accusing me of theft, said they would contact the U.S. and Mexican embassies, and publicly shamed me.Once I replied and the chef confirmed I had paid, the host silently retracted their demand — but then left a false, retaliatory review claiming I never paid and contacted them at 4am (I have screenshots proving otherwise). I submitted all this to Airbnb, but despite the proof, Airbnb refused to remove the false review or hold the host accountable.This situation has made me feel unsafe using the platform. Hosts like this, who escalate misunderstandings with threats and dishonesty, should not be allowed to operate under Airbnb’s name. Airbnb needs stronger protections for guests and should stand behind the proof they ask us to provide.",1
Listings with Mold: No refund or relocation,"I contacted Airbnb on 7/27/2025 when I discovered two kinds of mold in the apartment that I spent $4,948.74 on. I provided photos and videos of the mold on the bedroom walls, behind the headboard, and on the pillows. I asked for relocation to an accommodation that adhered to Airbnb’s Health and Safety Standards as listed on their website.Airbnb’s Health and Safety Standard’s clearly state that listings must be “free of known hazards (ex: mold),” which I reiterated many times over the eight hours I communicated with support.I communicated that I needed an accommodation that met their Health and Safety Standards, but Airbnb refused to relocate me because “it would be a long hassle” and “they have to give the host a chance so it is a fair outcome.” They also told me I wasn’t allowed to clean the mold, but had to live in it, as they wanted to investigate.Airbnb claimed to have tried to call me, but there was no missed call from them, and then they closed my case.I spent six days contacting Airbnb.Airbnb refused to provide a refund or a health inspection: their Health and Safety policy is a lie. I was left in an unsafe environment with no meaningful support or resolution.I used Airbnb because I thought they provided and guaranteed a level of safety to their customers, but this is a marketing facade for exploitation.",1

Airbnb Refused Reimbursement Despite Clear Evidence of Guest Damage!,"I am extremely disappointed with Airbnb’s AirCover program. My guest caused significant property damage, and I followed every single step Airbnb asked — submitting videos, photos, receipts, and even shop invoices with official email documentation.Yet, Airbnb refused my reimbursement, citing misrepresentation without providing any solid explanation. This is completely unfair and feels like a betrayal of trust, especially from a company that promotes ""host protection.""I’ve hosted with care and professionalism. But after this experience, I no longer feel safe or supported on Airbnb.🔴 I’ve now filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and I’m preparing to go public via social media, YouTube, and press.

The customer service was very poor.No viable reason or explanation given.,1
Airbnb allows retaliatory reviews that violate their own policy,"I’ve been a responsible host on Airbnb, but I’m extremely disappointed by how they handled a recent situation that clearly violates their own review policy.A guest stayed in my property for 32 days and left a 5-star review. After their stay, I left them an honest 1-star review because they caused significant damage to the apartment. I also filed a reimbursement request through Airbnb.In retaliation, the guest left me a 1-star review on a separate 1-day reservation (which occurred immediately after the 32-day stay) — using the exact same damage that I reported as their “reason.” This is a textbook example of a retaliatory review, which is explicitly prohibited by Airbnb’s Review Policy.Despite multiple messages to Airbnb support, quoting their own policy, and submitting formal feedback, the company refused to remove the review and didn’t provide a valid reason. They also refused to escalate the case to a senior case manager or Trust & Safety.As a host, this undermines my trust in the platform. Reviews are supposed to reflect real experiences — not be used as revenge when a host seeks reimbursement for damages. This is not only unfair, but sets a dangerous precedent for other hosts who rely on Airbnb’s policies to be enforced consistently.Airbnb, I’m asking for this to be reviewed properly by someone in a position to apply the policy as written.",1
Non existent customer service,"Customer service is not just bad it is actually non-existent. I have now been permanently banned from Airbnb. They have not given any reason. I am not allowed to book Airbnb properties to stay in, or rent out my property on Airbnb. No human is available to tell me why this action has been taken. They are judge jury and executioner. They have an appeal system, but again it is impossible to ask why I have been banned or to speak to an actual  person about it. It is Kafkaesque. I have used Airbnb for 10 years+ and always had good reviews both renting out and staying at properties. I think that someone may have hacked my account and done something but Airbnb is unable to even tell me what I am accused of. Unbelievable.  The only good result is that I now use Booking.com instead and I find it to be superior in every way and amazingly it has actual human beings you can talk to and discuss any issues. All that Airbnb has is call centre agents in the Philipines who know absolutely nothing, have zero authority and also continually lie to cover up their lack of knowledge and ability.",1
Charge back claim after positive review,"We rented an apartment with airbnb in France. We paid 4000 eur for just over a week stay. The apartment had a lovely view and was large but it wasnt properly clean when we arrived- dust/spider webs in the corners/under furniture, dirty cups/dishes with previous users stains on them, kitchen filter covered in grease... We also experienced a broken boiler and shutter during our stay- both of which we facilitated repair people for and made no issue of. The owner gave us positive feedback on leaving and we did the same for him- for peace sake, however 2 weeks after doing so we got a text from the owner asking us to contribute to the broken shutter either directly to him or he would claim it back via airbnb. We couldn't believe it. We said no obviously- as the issue was clearly electrical as it wouldn't open. I've had good experiences with Airbnb before but this incident left such a sour taste in our mouth I'm not sure we'd ever use them again.",2
I would give no stars if I could,"I’m an Airbnb host and have just had one of the most frustrating experiences with their so-called ""customer service."" I lost a confirmed booking because the support agent completely ignored clear instructions, even after I repeatedly explained over the phone what was needed and asked them to read the guest messages.My guest and I had agreed on a total price of £1,400 including fees, but the agent instead set the room rate to £1,400 and let Airbnb add their service fee on top — pushing the guest’s total to nearly £1,635. Naturally, the guest cancelled. All of this could have been avoided if the rep had simply followed instructions. I spent over 2.5 hours on the phone trying to fix their mistake and still got nowhere.Airbnb keeps outsourcing support to overseas call centres where communication is inconsistent and accountability is nonexistent. This isn’t about nationality — it’s about basic professionalism and training. If Amazon can provide fast, competent customer service, so can Airbnb. There are no excuses.Airbnb needs to stop cutting corners, invest in properly trained staff who can communicate clearly, and start taking responsibility when their systems or teams get it wrong. Hosts deserve better.",1
Awful air b and b support- don’t trust reviews …,"I have used air b and b  few times over the years and had good experiences with accommodation being identical to listings. However my last 2 stays have been significantly not as described despite 5 star reviews. In one stay the host was offering 5 star reviews for 5 star reviews back. I complained to the host about the apartment being significantly not as described and he left me an awful review.  The second one was an illegal air b and b with posters all around the apartment building saying that we shouldn’t be there. The apartment pictured was not the one we were  given.  I complained to air b and b support with both and they did nothing. The listing for the illegal air b and b is still up with the misleading pictures.I think if you are lucky enough to get a good let that doesn’t have any issues you will be fine, but if you have any issues at all air b and b support is awful and you can’t trust the reviews. I will never book with them again.",1
Not What I Expected,"I'm giving this one star because the experience has become frustrating. The prices are just getting out of hand and to make things worse, I still can't believe you can't see the actual location of the place until you've already paid. It feels like a bait-and-switch",2
Mold issue - no customer protection,"We (my husband, 2-year-old son, and I) booked this Airbnb where we discovered a strong mildew smell. Being a property manager myself, I knew the nature of smell - it was water damage: musty, super humid, damp, etc. There was also a dehumidifier in the bedroom, which confirmed hosts knew about the issue.We contacted the host, asking about the smell and reminding that we have a 2 year old with us, and mold is a health hazard. The host denied any issue. She suggested maybe it's a dead rat in the walls (?!), apologized for the inconvenience and said we could move upstairs. Upstairs didn't have a proper bathroom or bedroom. Also, we did not paid $4000 for 11 days to stay at half of the apartment.Later, we discovered a large mold spot (about 2x2 feet) hidden behind a panel. Hosts knew about it, they just hid it. And lied even when were asked directly.We then contacted Airbnb support because host's ""resolution"" wasn't suitable nor staying the place was healthy or safe. The smell was itching our throats, it was terrible. Airbnb advised us to leave due to the health risk and promised a refund and protection from retaliatory reviews. We moved out, booked a hotel, and found a new Airbnb. This was a huge inconvenience, loss of money and time.Sure enough, the host left us a 3-star review (while we stayed at her place only 1 night), and Airbnb refused to remove it - even though we followed all their instructions.

Upon arrival on 18 Jun, there were no immediate issues but I started to get bug bites. At first, I assumed it was the local mosquitos but upon inspection of the mattress I became concerned that there was a bed bug infestation. The evening of 16 Jul, I immediately contacted the AirBnB host and AirBnB support. The host and AirBnB received documentation of what I believed to be bed bugs, as well as extensive pictures of the bites on my body. The host coordinated local pest control to treat the AirBnB on 18 Jul. After the chemical treatment, I spoke to the pest control rep and he confirmed that a second treatment is needed, and I should get a report that the AirBnB is truly bed bug free before I sleep on the bed. They also confirmed that the earliest a re-inspection could occur is 25 Jul. The host sent me the official pest control report, which noted that the bed bugs had been there months before my arrival, and that a second treatment is needed on 1 Aug at the earliest. I expressed same day I did NOT want to stay in this AirBnB and be forced to live out of bags, sleeping on a couch or my car, etc. I was eventually able to get out of that AirBnB the evening of 21 Jul because the hotel I booked on 19 Jul was uninhabitable. I was reimbursed for the nights I did not stay at this AirBnB, and the hosts/AirBnB pocketed full cost of the days I spent in the bed-bug infested AirBnB. On 26 Jul, I checked the listing and it was being advertised for dates before 1 Aug 25. I elevated my concerns to AirBnB and they confirmed it was an active listing, and simply ""assured"" me they ""have a detailed report of the bed bug issue [I] experience and [their] team is working with the host to take care of it."" I find it disgusting that AirBnB would allow a host to advertise their AirBnB without confirmation it was truly bed-bug free/only receiving one chemical treatment.",1
Airbnb’s host referral program is a…,"Airbnb’s host referral program is a complete mess. I referred a host based on their promise of a referral bonus worth 1600 DKK, but since then, I’ve only received conflicting and unclear answers from support.One agent told me I’d get the bonus after a second booking. Another said the booking just needs to be at least 50 USD. A third claimed it has to be 100 USD total. And now they’re telling me to contact the host I referred — even though the bonus is supposed to come from Airbnb, not the host.I’ve asked multiple times for someone from Airbnb Europe to respond with a clear explanation and a reference to the official terms and conditions, but no one has provided anything concrete. I feel misled, and frankly, it looks like Airbnb is intentionally making it difficult to claim the promised bonus.Until they take responsibility and clarify their own program, I cannot recommend relying on their referral system. This has been a frustrating and unprofessional experience.",1
Stranded in Menorca.,"I arrived at my Airbnb accommodation to find the host had cancelled the booking mere hours after check-in time—after I had already arrived. This abrupt cancellation not only breached Airbnb’s own policies around host accountability but left me stranded without support, redress, or viable alternatives.Airbnb’s response was procedural and dismissive, showing little regard for the inconvenience, cost, and disruption caused. The platform’s refusal to take responsibility or offer timely resolution exposes a fundamental flaw: a system that allows hosts to cancel post-arrival without consequence, while leaving guests vulnerable.Despite multiple attempts to escalate the issue, Airbnb failed to acknowledge the breach of contract and the clear violation of their customer care standards. Their evasiveness and reliance on generic messaging demonstrate a disregard for user experience and consumer protection.This experience raises serious questions about Airbnb’s reliability, enforcement of its own terms, and the ethical treatment of guests. I would caution others to be aware of the risk of post-check-in cancellations, and the limited protections currently offered by the platform. Air BnB were aware I was with individuals with disabilities. A wheelchair user with a serious medical condition and 3 children with autism.",1

However, not only was I ignored — Airbnb has since stopped responding entirely.Every time I open a new support request, it is silently closed without explanation or resolution. I am no longer receiving any responses from human agents. This seems to be a deliberate tactic to silence hosts who speak up.I have been hosting professionally for years and have upheld Airbnb's standards. This treatment is deeply disappointing, unprofessional, and disrespectful to hosts who have helped build this platform.I am now preparing to file formal complaints with consumer protection organizations, and I will be sharing this experience publicly until I receive a fair response: either reimbursement for the damages or removal of the malicious review. Airbnb cannot continue to intimidate and silence its hosts like this.I demand escalation to the Content Integrity Team and Trust & Safety Team. Enough is enough.",1
Airbnb allowed my reservation to be cancelled unfairly- Guest left unprotected,"I had a very disappointing experience with Airbnb and a host who refused to help me in good faith.I booked a property and paid in two installments. The second payment failed due to insufficient funds in my account at the time. However, I transferred the required amount before the final deadline, expecting Airbnb’s system to retry the payment. Instead, Airbnb canceled my reservation automatically on May 18th at 11:53 AM, even though the cancellation policy stated that if canceled before May 19th at 3 PM, a 50% refund would apply.I immediately contacted the host, explained the situation, and offered to rebook and pay in full. He refused and later re-listed the property at a lower price. Airbnb told me the host kept the difference, and they could not do anything because the cancellation was considered to be “on my behalf”—even though it was triggered by their system, not by me.Airbnb ignored my requests for fairness and accountability. Their senior manager offered me only a $100 AUD coupon and closed the case, despite my repeated attempts to explain and find a middle ground.Meanwhile, I lost over $600 AUD, even though I did everything I could to fix the issue in time. The host had the chance to help and didn’t. Airbnb allowed it and stood behind “policy,” not fairness.If you’re a guest, please be aware: Airbnb’s policies do not protect you when things go wrong, even when you act in good faith. Hosts can profit from technical issues, and you’ll be left with no meaningful support.",1

Pans, Pots, Cutlery and plates had dried food and grease on them from previous use and uncleaned. Mould in the showers and on the walls.

It was removed by them saying I was being “coercive” I have appealed under their laborious and boring process but they haven’t even bothered to respond.

I left the property within **50 minutes** of arrival because it was simply unlivable.Airbnb's response? They kept demanding **pictures**, even though I explained the situation clearly. How can you tell from pictures that it's working or not if the lights are showing fine. Still, they **outright rejected** my refund request.I'm shocked at how little they care about guests who have been loyal for years. **This will be the last time I ever use Airbnb.** Pathetic service and terrible customer support.",1

Airbnb Failed to Protect Us from a Dishonest Guest – Hosts Beware,"Guest – Hosts BewareWe are experienced Airbnb hosts with a 5-star property in the South of France. After years of consistently high ratings and excellent guest feedback, we recently had a deeply upsetting experience with a dishonest guest.The guest booked a 5-night stay, arrived over 4 hours late, stayed only one night, and made false claims (backed by no evidence) that our property was “unlivable” — citing a single ant and a smell. Despite our home being professionally cleaned, photographed prior to check-in, and consistently reviewed as immaculate, Airbnb sided with the guest without giving us a proper opportunity to address the claims.Worse still, the guest sent abusive WhatsApp messages and made accusations which clearly violated Airbnb’s community standards — yet the review was allowed to remain, permanently damaging our listing’s credibility.Airbnb failed to uphold its own policies and refused to remove a false, retaliatory review. We’re now left with damage to our hard-earned reputation and no real support.This platform is fundamentally unsafe for hosts when bad-faith guests are protected over factual evidence and respectful conduct.",1

"Airbnb supports heartless refund policies – I lost $1,677 due to their inaction","I had a terrible experience with an Airbnb host named Hector Velez, and Airbnb did absolutely nothing to help.I accidentally booked two properties for the same dates. I contacted Airbnb and the host 4 days before check-in to explain and cancel. The host refused to refund even a cent, despite the reasonable notice — all because of his “strict cancellation policy.”Airbnb told me to cancel and promised a partial refund of $170, and said the host had 72 hours to refund the remaining $1,677. After the deadline passed, they simply said:“The host declined. There’s nothing we can do.”To make things worse, Hector Velez blocked those dates after my cancellation, so no one else could book them — but he still kept the full amount.I understand policies are policies — but where is the fairness? Where is Airbnb’s responsibility to protect guests from this kind of heartless behavior?Airbnb washed their hands and offered no support, no pressure on the host, and no empathy.I lost $1,677 for a simple human mistake.

We were stranded in another country, different language and had to accommodate to a 2 bedroom apartment instead of a 6.I reached out to Airbnb but all they did was refund my money and gave me a $25 additional credit for me to find another booking on my own.

Experience with host and Airbnb support team,"On 8/2, I contacted a host named Natalia regarding her Cali Beach Getaway listing. I was interested in booking from 8/14 to 8/17 and asked if a late checkout would be possible, since my family’s flight was later in the afternoon. She confirmed it was fine and sent me a pre-approval email clearly stating that I had until 9:30 PM on 8/3 to complete the booking before the invitation expired.Since I needed to confirm the dates with my family, I followed up with the host at 10:39 AM on 8/3 — well before the stated expiration time. To my surprise, I was told the listing had already been booked by someone else earlier that morning. This left me completely confused and frustrated, as I had every reason to believe the listing was being held for me until the agreed-upon deadline.Still, I remained polite and pointed out that the pre-approval email gave me until 9:30 PM to book. I explained that I simply needed time to coordinate with my family. The host and co-host read my message but never responded. Not acknowledging a reasonable concern, especially after clear communication and a commitment, is not just unprofessional — it’s disrespectful. It made me feel like my time and intentions were dismissed entirely. It also gave the impression that the hosts were more interested in securing a quicker booking than honoring their word or treating potential guests with basic courtesy.To make matters worse, when I tried to report the situation to Airbnb, I couldn’t find a straightforward way to leave feedback through the app. I contacted support and had to jump through several hoops just to explain the situation. One of the agents kept misunderstanding me and confused my issue with a past reservation that had no relevance at all. Despite multiple attempts to clarify, the conversation only caused more stress and wasted even more of my time.This entire experience has been extremely upsetting. It wasn’t just a case of losing out on a booking — it was about being misled, ignored, and then mishandled by both the host and Airbnb’s support. It’s made me question whether I want to continue using this platform to make travel plans, and whether guest concerns are truly valued at all.",1

Airbnb Can No Longer Be Trusted,"Airbnb Can No Longer Be Trusted – Misleading Listings and Poor OversightAfter a recent stay at a property listed as Large Luxury estate located in East Stroudsburg, PA  that I booked through Airbnb, I’ve lost confidence in the platform entirely. What was advertised and what was actually delivered were two very different things—and unfortunately, this doesn’t seem to be an isolated case.The listing we booked was presented as a high-quality, well-maintained property. In reality, it fell far short of those claims. The real issue, however, is not just the host or the property itself—it’s Airbnb’s role in enabling and sustaining these kinds of misleading listings.Airbnb presents itself as a platform that holds hosts to certain standards, yet time and time again, inaccurate descriptions, outdated photos, and subpar conditions are overlooked or ignored. When problems arise, there’s often little to no accountability or meaningful resolution. This creates a situation where guests are taking all the risk, while Airbnb continues to profit.It’s deeply frustrating to spend time and money based on a promise of quality, only to discover that Airbnb does not enforce its own standards. This experience has made it clear: Airbnb cannot be relied upon for truthful listings, consistent quality, or guest protection.I do not recommend using Airbnb. Until the platform takes responsibility for ensuring listings are accurate, sanitary, and safe, travelers are better off using services that offer genuine quality control and customer support.",1

AWFUL. THE WORST. STAY AWAY.,"I am absolutely, positively DONE with Airbnb, which is saying a lot, because I despise Expedia, the new owners of VRBO as well.I booked a trip for July 2025. I had to cancel the day prior to our arrival for a medical emergency. I had also purchased insurance for this trip. I was assured by an agent, IN WRITING, that I would receive a full refund.Fast forward, no refund has been issued. The conversation where the agent stated, IN WRITING, that I would be refunded has magically disappeared. They tried to say that support conversations are automatically deleted after a certain period of time and that I didn't cancel the reservation. NONE of this makes sense, especially the fact that I still had a support message in my account from MAY.Unfortunately for me, because I hosted with Airbnb in the past and could not stand how incessant and harassing their automated messages were, I had disabled communications. I tried to re-enable messages after I stopped hosting but it never worked (gee, I wonder why). So all I have to go on was the history THEY provided.I wonder why, if I failed to cancel the reservation like they just said, that I received a partial refund. I just didn't receive the full amount like they promised - IN WRITING - that has magically disappeared.Never again.",1

It clearly hadn’t been cleaned. We took photos and a video to document everything.We spent our first hour trying to deal with the mess, which caused me to miss a paid appointment. A cleaner was later sent but mistakenly threw away some of our belongings, possibly due to the chaos in the flat. The WiFi speed was unusable (1 Mbps), making remote work impossible.Most troubling, the host offered compensation in exchange for not leaving a negative review - which we reported to Airbnb. Despite clear evidence of the property being unfit for guests and the host acting unprofessionally, Airbnb refused to issue a proper refund. We were offered only a token 10% refund for the affected nights.This property was not as advertised, and Airbnb failed to take meaningful action. The support process felt slow, impersonal, and dismissive. I used to trust Airbnb, but after this experience, I’ll be extremely cautious about booking through them again - and I urge others to be careful as well.",1

Airbnb still decided against me, relying solely on the host’s invoice for a replacement and ignoring the suspicious timing and lack of direct proof.I feel I’ve been unfairly blamed and charged €150 without proper evidence.

Avoid Airbnb and Valhalla View,"Booked a 5* 2 night stay in Valhalla View, Scarsferry, Scotland.  Pictures looked amazing and it cost us just shy of £1000 for 2 nights. When we arrived at the property, the house itself looked impressive,  but it was surrounded by what can only be described as a junk yard. On closer inspection the property had not been cleaned.  Windows were filthy, surfaces covered in fingerprints, dirty laundry basket full to the brim. Dirty robe hung on the door, bleach stained towels, dirty floors. Outside there were nesting birds in the roof that had created a large pile of excrement. The grass was waist hight, so the view from the hot tub was long grass to the front, a broken down van to the left and bird poop behind. I could go on, but you get the point. I wrote to the host who made no apology.  He told me it was my choice if I looked at the van. That he could not remove the nesting birds and the long grass was assisting the wildlife... no mention of the appalling cleaning or removal of bird droppings. He did offer a full refund if I left the property,  but I'm 6 hours from home at this stage, with no chance of making a reservation in the Highlands in the hight of summer.  I informed him I would rather stay, but an apology would have helped and some form of reimbursement. I heard nothing back from the host directly.  Around an hour later I received a phone call from Airbnb. The operator informed me the host would like to cancel my booking and asked I leave the property.  I explained all of the above and asked what his justification was in asking me to leave. Apparently you are not allowed to offend a host by giving them accurate feedback of a property.  The airbnb call advisor said he would speak to the host and get back to me. When I received a further call we were given ""permission"" to stay.  On return from our trip I made contact with the support team to discuss the matter further and report this listing as inaccurate. I provided multiple photographs of the issue and was told they would investigate.  I was then informed that none of this violated airbnb's standards and they would not refund anything and I would have to contact the host again, if I wished to take any further action. When the host has already been unreasonable and taken no accountability, how can that even be an option! I spent the entire time i was there, worried he was going to come by the property and try to remove us again. It totally ruined our trip and anniversary. Airbnb should have investigated the matter when the host initially contacted them, and told him he had no grounds to remove us. I did not want to stay after the way we were treated and the state of the property,  but I had no choice! Im disgusted by the way we have been treated by both the host and Airbnb.",1

We arrived few hours ago in Fort…,"I’m extremely disappointed in Airbnb support. My son and I arrived at our rental in Fort Lauderdale by the sea, after barely sleeping the night before, expecting to check in at the scheduled time (3:00 PM). The host first offered early check-in for $25, but then told us—after we were already on site—that we couldn’t even check in at the regular time because the cleaning crew wasn’t available. We were told we’d have to wait until 4 or even 6 PM.Airbnb support's solution? “Leave your luggage and go eat,” offering a $50 reimbursement — but we had nowhere to go, and we were exhausted. When we finally got in, the apartment had clearly been “cleaned” in 20 minutes or less. It was dirty, extremely dated, the sofa was stained and uncomfortable, and it looked nothing like the photos.There were no basic amenities — no welcome water, no beach chairs or umbrella (just some towels), and no space to dry wet clothes. This is not what we paid for. Airbnb’s support felt scripted and unhelpful — no real resolution, just “wait and deal with it.” I feel completely let down and will think twice before booking with Airbnb again.",1
"Severe financial damage, disrespect towards business travellers, unprofessional customer service","During the last 5 bookings, I experienced very bad customer service by various AirBnB teams. Requests were not properly read, answers were generous, decisions stalled over days or weeks, and no respect for the time of the customer. After endless discussions, I was forwarded to the next team and had explain everything again - same process. To the third, sometimes even the fourth team.We used AirBnB four business trip to major tradefairs in the past, but decided not to do so in the future. The customer service is a waste of time and disrespects business travelers. The teams have caused a 2000€ damage and additional wasted costs only for the last case. This is not professional at all.",1

For the host breaking the rules and law!!! No way absolute shocking cusmtwr service !!! I will now go for compensation, the police will be informed and video and photo evidence in hand !!",1
A Disappointing Experience Made Worse by Airbnb’s Lack of Accountability,"I have been a loyal Airbnb user for years, both as a guest and a former host, but this most recent experience left me deeply disappointed. It was not just the host’s lack of empathy that hurt, but Airbnb’s refusal to take responsibility or provide any transparency.Shortly after making a reservation, I experienced a death in my family. I contacted the host within 30 minutes of booking, politely asking if they would consider a partial or full refund due to the circumstances. The host declined, and Airbnb advised me to work with them directly. The situation quickly became even more frustrating, with the host showing no compassion and Airbnb refusing to assist beyond repeating policy.Later, I left a respectful and honest review of my experience, which Airbnb removed without explanation. I reached out multiple times to ask what specific policy I had violated. Every time, Airbnb refused to clarify and stated only that the decision was final and they would disengage from further discussion.Even now, I have received no clear answers or real support. I filed a formal complaint through the BBB, and Airbnb responded with a vague, generic message that failed to address my specific concerns. After reviewing other customer complaints, it became clear that Airbnb is simply copy-pasting the same response across multiple cases, regardless of the issue. This lack of personalized or sincere engagement is unacceptable for a platform that claims to value its community.If Airbnb deletes reviews that reflect poorly on hosts, even during personal emergencies, how can travelers trust that the platform is truly transparent or reliable?This is not just about a refund. It is about basic decency, honest customer service, and consumer protection. Airbnb failed on all of those fronts.",1
As a host,"As a host, their cancellation fees are a scam. They claimed I owed them 388.00 for a cancellation from 4 (FOUR!) years ago. Didn't mention it, didn't let me know, remind me.  Just waited until I had hosted again and deducted it. This is despite the fact that I had detailed conversations FOUR years ago (which, understandably, I can't remember now!) to eaplain why I was cancelling and they accepted the reasoning by phone and no mention was made of the fee being 100% of the booking!SCAMMERS",1
"If anything goes wrong, no one will help you in any way","I am 23 years old. I don’t often use air bnb as have always used booking.com / hostelworld when travelling. My family bought a boat from our extended family a few years ago but haven’t had time to restore it. It is VERY old and is pretty much in bits. Me and my boyfriend came out for a month to begin deep cleaning it to help speed up the process as my dad is in the middle of retiring and is going to start coming out now to fix it up. After 2 weeks we found many issues with the boat and had to get someone out to repair it for a few days. We are staying in a small beach village with little apartments etc so we booked with air bnb as more options in a closer town for 2 people and our first stay was perfect. We had to book an additional night somewhere the day before as went on a day longer than expected. I explained the situation and they accepted through text. Then they started saying i had to rebook it as I hadn’t completed it - when in actuality the host hadn’t confirmed the booking through the system. Eventually they realised their mistake after back and forth in which i was very respectful / responsive as i don’t often use air bnb so wanted to know how to do it and thought initially it was my mistake. They didn’t acknowledge their mistake after it was confirmed and just started sending the usual copy and paste of all the details. I thought it was fine - I didn’t leave a review as i thought maybe there was a language barrier and the host didn’t mean to come off rude although i guess deep down i did have a bad taste in my mouth. We stayed for 1 night and left the place spotless as we didn’t eat or really spend any time there. We just used it for a bed for the night. The host left a review saying how young I was (Claire is very young!!!) and she thought my “strategy of getting a boat repaired 10 km away from us is very very strange” and “she didn’t understand it”. I contacted airbnb with absolutely no help or resolution. This may sound silly but i don’t understand why it appears that people are protected on this app. What i have learned about airbnb in comparison to other providers is that they will DO nothing to help you if something goes wrong - when things go fine, great but if ANYTHING and i mean ANYTHING goes wrong - that is it. Why can people (host or guests) leave a review with nothing to do with someone’s stay especially in such a negative way ? Now that will effect if i wanted to book other properties on the app and for what? She left other comments that can’t be accessed in my review just through my profile - special thanks as neat and tidy as well other suggestions try to communicate in a helpful way? We caused no issues and while communicating i was in no way passive aggressive, i was extremely open and respectful as I was just unsure how to fix the problem. I sent in my passport etc before- I have no problem with being 23 and I wasn’t hiding it. It honestly is a service that doesn’t seem to protect anyone- guest or host. I deleted my account as I do not want to support a company that allows such untrue, unprofessional and unsolicited reviews. I honestly never comment on anything good or bad but for some reason this has genuinely really affected me - it feels so uncalled for and unfair?",1
The support for hosts is fast but many times not helpfull,"Support is outsourced, with aim to close the tickets very fast, so some of them don't take the time to understand and resolve, just to close the tickets.As host you are supposed to serve the guests, but Airbnb itself is not that good to serve the hosts.Review system for hosts have some room for improvement",2
Account banned without reason,"I have been on this platform for many years but soon as I went to Colombia I noticed that there was alot of discrimination against tourists. There are signs everywhere at the airport and hotels against no sex with minors nor prostitution. Things that are obvious in other countries. I suppose this is a serious issue that the Americans have caused.However, I am a solo traveller and I make new friends everywhere i go. The hosts on airbnb have accused me of hiring prostitutes without any proof or evidence at all. All based on assumptions because I always ask if visitors are allowed. So they accuse my friends of being prostitutes which is very insulting! Airbnb then chooses to ban my account without any investigation nor contact.",1

Fraudulent host in Brazil,"Fraudulent claim and retaliatory review allowed by Airbnb – serious breach of policy and trustI rented a property through Airbnb where the host later filed a false damage claim, which Airbnb investigated and rejected due to lack of evidence. Despite this, the host’s retaliatory review accusing me vaguely of misconduct was allowed to remain.This is a clear violation of Airbnb’s own Review Policy, which prohibits reviews linked to extortion or financial disputes. I submitted multiple appeals, with evidence, and yet Airbnb refused to remove the review.This is a case of fraud and manipulation of the review system, undermining guest protection. Airbnb has refused to act, raising serious concerns about fairness, consumer rights, and the integrity of their platform.I request immediate escalation of this case to Airbnb’s Trust & Safety team and a full investigation. I am prepared to escalate this through other legal and consumer protection avenues if no resolution is offered.",1
AirBnB are liars and frauds,"We rented a villa in Portugal which was a disaster and the host asked for money instead of paying via AirBnB, we partially paid and requested a discussion about the lack of water and heating and having to move out. We then discovered the client had AirBnB collect money. On complaining AirBnB then promised to look into. All words and smokes and mirrors. I have initiated a small claims after they even had the cheek to pretend to call me back and sent a reply I didn't make . Sharik, senior case manager, gave one ring and then dialled off and then claimed I had said all is settled. I will be going through the small claims court, AirBnB and Sharik, absolute charlatans and pathetic",1

This is pathetic and the worst handling of B2B partners I can imagine. Very very very sad.",1

Poor customer service,"After 10 years as a loyal Airbnb guest with no prior complaints, I’m extremely disappointed in how my recent issue was handled. I was pressured to pay an event fee that was never included in the official Airbnb fee breakdown—it was arranged off-platform, which violates Airbnb’s own policies.The property was marketed as event-ready, yet it was poorly maintained, unclean, and had a safety hazard we had to address ourselves (an open pit near children). The only “event support” was a leaf blower and trash bags.Despite raising legitimate safety and policy concerns and providing full documentation, Airbnb’s response was dismissive, and they continued to pressure me to pay an improper fee. When I reminded them of their own policy violations, I received a vague threat about account suspension.Airbnb’s platform no longer feels safe or trustworthy. I’ve officially left after a decade of great experiences. This situation has shown a serious lack of guest protection and accountability.",1

Warning: Avoid Airbnb – They Don’t Protect You,"Title:I’m writing this to warn other users: do not trust Airbnb to protect you or your money. A booking was made on my account without my permission while I was completely unavailable. I reported it immediately, but Airbnb took days to respond. Because of their delay, I lost the chance to get a refund – even though the host initially agreed to give me one.To make matters worse, some key messages were deleted (possibly by the host), and Airbnb refused to provide proof of how the booking was made or from what device. Their so-called security is a joke – they charged my card without proper authorisation and still blamed me for it.Support was useless – calling me at 2am and 4am, offering no real help, and ultimately doing nothing to fix the situation. I’ve lost my money, and Airbnb refuses to take any responsibility.If you value your time, money, and peace of mind – stay away from Airbnb. Their system is not secure, and they will not help you if something goes wrong.",1
I’ve been using Airbnb for a while,"I’ve been using Airbnb for a while, but this recent experience has completely broken my trust.Multiple payouts I was supposed to receive came up short — the amount Airbnb says they sent is not what reached my account. I opened eight different cases, submitted official bank statements as they requested, and still got copy-paste replies with no real investigation. After wasting my time and energy, they closed each case with no explanation.No one helped. I repeatedly asked to speak to a real manager — no response. I even requested to file a complaint against customer support, and they ignored that too.Airbnb’s customer service is unresponsive, dismissive, and careless. I’ve now filed complaints with the FTC and BBB, because this is not just a payout issue — it’s about how badly Airbnb treats its users.Hosts and guests deserve better",1
Airbnb policies allow for slanderous…,"Airbnb policies allow for slanderous content. It is a well known fact that slanderous statements written as fact (not opinion) have been regularly challenged in the US court system. Airbnb will build their brand and company off the hardworking property owners and hospitality operators then lock them into binding arbitration with no recourse. The Airbnb policy on reviews would technically allow for a person to describe a completely false and made up malicious story, one that a judge would consider slander. If an individual was to write slanderous statements about Airbnb their legal team would more than happily demand a review to be taken down. I am all for opinion based reviews and have no issue with honest reviews that don't score high, however, allowing scammers on the platform that abuse the review system makes me not believe Airbnb is a marketplace for premium accommodations. This is not a business model that will last long without change.",1

Very spacious,The Airbnb is in Northern Ireland and was very large and it easily fitted 12 people and could’ve filled a few more. It had three tvs two in the master bedrooms and one in the living area. It was VERY spacious and for the price it wasn’t too bad. The only problem was how isolated it was with no shops close by.

Despite multiple stays being completed, I still haven’t received several payouts that are over a month overdue.Here’s what’s happened so far:I’ve contacted Airbnb Support multiple times, but the responses have been generic, with no real resolution.I’ve confirmed that my payout method (bank/PayPal) is correct and functioning—no issues on my end.After researching online, I’ve seen numerous reports from other hosts who’ve faced similar delays, with some waiting up to 6 months (!) for their funds.Questions for the Community:Is anyone else currently experiencing delayed payouts? If so, how long have you been waiting?Has anyone found a way to escalate this successfully? Did calling support, filing a complaint, or reaching out on social media help?Are there any Airbnb reps in this group who can assist? This seems like a widespread issue that needs urgent attention.I’m deeply concerned because, like many of you, I rely on these payouts to cover expenses. Airbnb’s lack of transparency and resolution is unacceptable.If you’ve been through this before and have advice, please share your experience below. The more we raise awareness, the more pressure Airbnb will face to fix this.Thank you in advance for your help—let’s support each other in getting this resolved!#MissingPayouts #AirbnbHostProblems #PaymentDelays",1

I stayed at an Airbnb in Nice,"I stayed at an Airbnb in Nice, France, and was forced to leave early due to a cockroach infestation in the unit. I only stayed 3 out of the 7 nights I paid for. The issue was reported immediately, and I provided photo documentation. The hosts sent a technician but did not resolve the problem—and ultimately ignored all my messages after I left. I received no refund, no compensation, and no accountability. Airbnb offered me only a small monetary amount as a token of goodwill.I wrote a factual and respectful review, but Airbnb removed it, citing a “coercion” policy. Why? Because I had asked the host one last time to issue a refund before I posted it—something Airbnb’s own guidelines say guests should try to do. I did everything right, and still ended up silenced.Airbnb’s support of hosts who ignore safety issues while punishing guests for speaking up is incredibly disappointing. I’m now filing a chargeback and escalating through consumer protection.",1
"Misrepresented Airbnb, Zero Accountability — PayPal No Help Either","I never leave bad reviews, but I need to warn others about my experience with both Airbnb and PayPal.I booked a $4,200 Airbnb for a group of 8, traveling from across the U.S. and Ireland to bury my mom, dad, and sister. This was a painful, emotional trip, and I proactively reached out to the host before booking to ensure the home was appropriate.What we arrived to was shocking:•	Used band-aids and pimple patches in bedrooms and stuck to walls•	Food under the couch, leading to an ant infestation•	A sandy, moldy, dirty, and unprepared property•	A non-functioning refrigerator•	Broken furniture, torn table coverings, and missing beach amenities that were promised•	The house wasn’t even ready until nearly 7 PM on check-in dayWe immediately contacted Airbnb. I spent over a week, three live calls, and more than 25 messages trying to resolve this. Airbnb admitted they could not override the host’s decision and offered no refund beyond the cleaning fee — even though their own Guest Refund Policy clearly covers misrepresentation and unsanitary conditions.So I turned to PayPal, thinking their Buyer Protection would help. Despite submitting extensive documentation and photos, they denied the claim, saying the “item was materially similar to the listing.” How is a filthy, unsafe, pest-ridden home with a broken fridge similar to the polished listing photos?We couldn’t “just leave” — we were on a small island, with no alternatives, trying to mourn our family members. We made every good-faith effort to resolve this privately. Neither company upheld their own standards or protections.If you’re thinking Airbnb or PayPal will protect you when things go wrong — think again. We were left with the emotional and financial fallout, while both companies passed the buck.Do better.",1
I wish I could give this review zero…,"I wish I could give this review zero stars, because that's all AirBnB is worth. Recently I used AirBnB for a stay while I finished the purchase of my own place. Unfortunately I am disabled and once my host and roommates learned of my disability, I suddenly became a target and a scapegoat for all the problems the AirBnB was having. None of which there was any proof, but the stereotypical accusation became, ""He is disabled, so obviously he did it"". As a result, this host began wrongly demanding money from me. So, not wanting to be part of such a harsh, discriminate, toxic environment, I ended my stay at this AirBnB a week early. While living at a hotel, these past few weeks, has been a bit more expensive, I at least am living under a more friendly, accepting roof. Also, this host and AirBnB have refused to refund me the money for the unused seven nights of my last AirBnB stay. This host is also the third AirBnB host who has treated me like absolute garbage, has permitted or participated in discriminatory behaviors connected to my disability and has tried to scam money from me, with this last host being the worst of all.

I had a very disappointing experience…,"I had a very disappointing experience with an Airbnb listing hosted by Magda (Loft Berlin Kreuzberg Viktoriapark, 10965)Here are the facts I shared in my honest review, which Airbnb chose to delete without any real explanation:This is not a neutral rental unit – it's clearly a private apartment where the host lives full-time, filled with children’s toys, drawings, personal photos, and clutter, making the stay feel uncomfortable and intrusive.The photos on the listing are misleading. For example, in the center of the living room, there was a disturbing poster of a dissected chicken, while the listing photo showed a neutral image. This misrepresentation felt deliberate.The host controlled key handover rigidly – I wasn’t allowed to pick up the keys at a convenient time. She insisted on meeting me at a fixed hour and greeted me with a list of house rules in a cold, directive manner.I spent time writing a truthful, respectful review to help future guests—but Airbnb removed it, claiming a vague ""policy violation"" and refuses to let me write another. Meanwhile, this host is still active, and the misleading listing remains untouched.This raises a serious question: Is Airbnb prioritizing hosts’ ratings over guests’ rights and safety? I will be filing a formal complaint with consumer protection authorities.",1

Disappointed in Airbnb’s Handling of a…,"Disappointed in Airbnb’s Handling of a Serious Sanitation IssueI recently stayed at an Airbnb rental in Charlotte, NC for a work trip. On the third morning of our four-day stay, we discovered adult cockroaches in the unit. We immediately contacted our host, who unfortunately failed to offer a proper resolution.Following Airbnb’s policy, we escalated the issue to Airbnb Support. After multiple conversations with representatives, we were finally assigned a senior case manager who promised a refund of $691.16. This included:A 30% refund for the impacted nights (as covered by the AirCover policy)A full refund for our final night (which we did not spend at the property)$246.22 to help cover the cost of a hotel for the last nightHowever, the next day the case manager reversed his decision, saying he could now only offer a partial refund totaling $234.08, plus 20% of our hotel cost. The reason provided was that the refund had not been processed by the end of his shift. I was told by another representative that the original refund would still be honored and that someone would follow up by end of day — but no one reached out until the following afternoon, and the refund offer had been reduced.This sudden change, lack of communication, and failure to follow through not only disrupted our trip but seriously undermined my trust in Airbnb’s customer support and its AirCover guarantee. The experience felt unprofessional, inconsistent, and unfair, especially given that the sanitation issue was well-documented and acknowledged.I’ve been a longtime Airbnb user, but this experience has made me reconsider future bookings — particularly when support is most needed.",1
Worst Booking APP EVER,"Worst booking app EVER! One and done for me.Booked a stay during my daughter’s delivery date. Place not as expected, not a single family home as advertised (a duplex), homeless park nearby, lizards in home, door wouldn’t lock, tv not accessible in living room, no tvs in bedrooms, laundry supposedly in closet but wasn’t and was out in bedroom and super loud, dishwasher didn’t work, doors wouldn’t lock when exiting home, couch was so uncomfortable, rugs were dingy and dirty and felt gross to walk on, and the list goes on- all of which I just let go during the stay because what can you do… But THEN, to top it all off, I received a bill for a pet fee a week and a half later, which I paid BTW, when the listing clearly stated pets welcome and did not indicate a fee or note any specifics about payment for pets. Host even said how clean the home was upon exit but later sent pics to Air BNB, which indicated that she had gone through our trash bags to find kitty litter- which we weren’t trying to hid because we thought pets were welcome, so brought our 8 week kitten… but seriously, how weird is that to dig through someone’s trash, and then, to say home is clean but dig through the curbside trash bins to rip open bags- odd, and def not something I’d be willing to do… just eeewwww! She could’ve emailed me asking, and I would have gladly responded yes because again “pets are welcome.” I’m truly fine with a pet fee for my kitten; we pay to board most of the time anyhow, but since my daughter went into labor early that morning, we didn’t have time to board. Anyhow, all this just seems like an after the fact money grab to me when sent a week and an half after the stay ended and after reviewing saying “home left clean.” Home was in Columbia, SC under Ursula, apparently she has 8 listings in the area. So BEWARE!Also, dealing with ABNB support afterward was a nightmare. Let me be clear, once they let me know there was a request for funds I gladly said I’d pay it, just wanted info and details on what account would be charged. Support worker stopped messaging just mid convo when I questioned this, and later emailed me apologizing for his/her unprofessionalism. I’ve booked with Expedia for 20+ years and have had minor hiccups here or there but nothing that even made me angry, much less ever promoted me to sit down and write a review. But this experience was so crazy, I felt I needed to let others know. Maybe I’m in the wrong and blowing this out of proportion, but I’ve never been sent after the fact requests from Expedia or Priceline because pricing is clear and upfront, so this just all seemed so ridiculous to me.",1
"Ignored for 24 Hours, Then Blamed for Leaving – Disgusting Customer Service","I reported serious issues at my Airbnb stay at 8pm Friday — including loud noise at night, a filthy shared bathroom, and discriminatory comments from the host about my disabled parking rights (I have a valid blue badge).Airbnb took nearly 24 hours to properly respond, leaving me stuck in that environment all weekend. I finally had no choice but to leave and book somewhere else out of my own pocket — because they failed to help me in time.Now they’ve refused a refund, claiming I didn’t give them a chance. I have screenshots, photos, and a clear timeline proving I followed the rules. I’ve spent thousands with Airbnb and never had an issue until now — and this is how they treat loyal, respectful guests?Total disgrace. No duty of care, no real-time support, and no accountability.

Air BNB tried to rob me,"I had pushed the confirmation button in error and was being forced to either stay or pay for a place I could not enter due to a handicap. I contacted them seconds after it happened and they were pretty much blaming/ shaming  me and saying they could do nothing. That canceling would be too difficult on the host and the posting -that they could only give me $80 of my $900 back. I asked for a credit, that I would pay merchant fees, anything and they would not budge. They are not on the customers side. Thank goodness  the host had a soul and saw it was a total loss for me since I needed certain amenities. The host credited me back direct. I have spent $1,000’s for a decade with Airbnb to be treated like the enemy. They were literally going to rob me. It’s insane",1
Don’t use or EVER call this company.,"I made a booking through Airbnb and on the first night I discovered the mattress had collapsed, had a piece of metal sticking out and had a large blood stain on it and was covered with hair. Later the wifi kept dropping and I discovered that the host was entering my property without my express permission. I complained to Airbnb. They told me I should have moved out if I was unhappy with the property. This was difficult because I had to go to hospital daily for my cancer treatment and I was on my own and not well. It was a nightmare trying to sort out these problems with Airbnb and I never got any redress from them whatsoever. To add salt to the wound, Airbnb asked me to call them, which I did and which cost me £83.98.",1
Is Airbnb facilitating the hosting of migrants or undocumented workers?  ?,"I have been an Airbnb host for 13 years, the last 3 of which were as a Superhost. My recent inquiry was from an individual who signed the inquiry with a name different than the name on the account. He requested to book for 2 guests.When I inquired about the guests, I was advised they are “employees” of the “company” that owns the AirBNB account. The account identified 112 trips with 69 reviews in 3 years. I couldn't see what the reviews were without accepting the reservation request. I stated that the guests staying in my guest room while I was residing in the property needed to be registered with Airbnb directly. I was advised that as a company they book this way all the time and that I didn’t need to have the guests registered with Airbnb. I then asked for copies of drivers’ licenses for the two men who were going to stay in the guest bedroom next to my bedroom.  They declined to provide the licenses and withdrew their request.I called Airbnb customer support to ask about the situation and was advised that I could in fact host guests not registered on the platform - at my own risk. Is Airbnb facilitating the housing of migrants or undocumented workers?",1

"Huge disappointment Airbnb, Never again","I booked through Airbnb an accomodation in italy, just outside Rome.Well the house, that i paid for entirely as announced in their add, actually was only have the house, the beds were couches and the garden that i wanted to use for me and my dogs was Shared with other guests that stayed in the other half of the house that i actually had booked entirely. Also, the house was so dirty, run down, filthy and all over just disgusting. Airbnb offenes help through their mediation center, they continously repeated that we would find a way to settle this, but in the end they hide behind a 72 hrs rule. In my opinion dirt is dirt, and what should you do when you are 2000 km from home with 2 kids and 4 dogs?",1
"10-year loyal user, disappointed by Airbnb’s silence and lack of support","I’ve been on Airbnb for over 10 years as both a guest and a host, and always valued their service — until now.My partner and I submitted a carefully designed, eco-conscious Experience that aligns perfectly with Airbnb’s own mission: community-driven, nature-based, and locally authentic.Instead of approving or even giving a clear rejection, Airbnb ghosted the listing, offered no explanation, and then sent a generic “we won’t help further” response after multiple follow-ups.No violations, no feedback, no option to revise. Just silence and policy smokescreens.For a platform built on trust and transparency, this treatment of long-time users is deeply disappointing.

⭐ 1-star review,"⭐ 1-star review – Airbnb as a platform failed meI had one of the worst booking experiences ever through Airbnb — not just because of the property, but because of how the platform handled things afterward.The listing was completely misleading: broken furniture, unsanitary conditions, even insects crawling around. I left immediately, without spending a single night there.I contacted Airbnb with proof — photos, chats, all of it. Their “resolution”? A 30% voucher I don’t even want to use, because this was the kind of experience that makes you never want to book through Airbnb again.When I asked for proper compensation, they hid behind the host’s cancellation policy and ignored the obvious reality of what I encountered. No empathy, no accountability — just cold, scripted responses.As a customer who lost €560 and was treated like an inconvenience, I’m sharing this because people deserve to know: if something goes wrong, you are on your own. Airbnb does the bare minimum, and it’s incredibly disappointing.I used to trust this platform. Not anymore.",1
A stressful experience,"A stressful experience — be cautious when bookingI’m a single mum and booked an Airbnb for a special holiday with my 10-year-old daughter. It was slightly over budget but in the perfect location near our favourite beach.Just two weeks before the trip, the host cancelled due to a family emergency. Airbnb offered only £90 compensation, but comparable places were over £500 more. They told me to ask the host to cover the difference — despite already charging the host over £350 in cancellation fees.The host was unaware I’d only received £90, felt terrible, and kindly offered to contribute towards new booking. Meanwhile, Airbnb told me refunds could take 15 days because I used a credit card — information I was never given upfront.I ended up taking a day off work just to sort this out. After pushing for proper support, Airbnb finally added a £200 coupon, and the host helped cover the rest. I was able to rebook, but the entire situation caused a huge amount of stress.In the end, I lost time, peace of mind, and still worry about another last-minute cancellation. Airbnb needs to take more responsibility when hosts cancel — right now, most of the burden falls on guests.",1
They do not stand by their own policies,"I’ve been a loyal Airbnb guest with a 5-star rating, but this recent experience has made me cancel my future reservations and decide never to use the platform again.I booked a property for a milestone celebration. The listing was misrepresented , the theater room AC didn’t work, there was no surround sound as advertised, the pool table was unusable, the Jack-and-Jill bathroom had an 8+ minute hot water delay, and the kitchen sink was leaking onto the floor.When I raised these issues, the property manager falsely accused us of being aggressive and unnecessarily called 911, leading to our group being removed mid-stay. I have video proof showing we remained calm and respectful.While the host refunded me the amount she could, Airbnb refuses to refund $150.26 for travel insurance, even though their own policy states that when a reservation is canceled by Airbnb or the host, the travel insurance can be canceled within 14 days (if no claim is filed). I never filed a claim, yet they continue to ignore this.Their customer service has been unprofessional and inconsistent ,  one representative (Tanisha) was dismissive and couldn’t even form coherent sentences. Despite escalating to the CEO’s office, Airbnb has prolonged this simple resolution for weeks.If a company cannot honor its own written policies, what trust can any guest have?

The first request failed because their verification system is faulty and said I wasn’t certified. I went into my account, it is verified. The host agreed to give me a discount to match the rate I tried to book at, which raised after, so I tried again. This time it flagged me as a possible unauthorized party, even though I had already told the host I was having a party and they were fine with it. I called Airbnb for help and they told me they couldn’t do anything but would submit it to a specialized team that would respond in 24 hours. No one ever contacted me, and while I waited someone else booked it. It’s gone. And when I called again, they said my whole account was flagged and the previous people I spoke to never escalated my case to the team, and I’d actually have to wait 72 hours for them to maybe reach out and maybe let me use my account. The whole thing is ridiculous. They’ve got no support, they will not help you with anything, they’ll just tell you to wait a long time for help that will never come. They should be shut down.",1

Horrible costumer service,"Horrible costumer service. I arrived in Malta a couple of days ago with an Airbnb booked worth 1260 euros. I booked for 8 days. When I arrived the Airbnb was horrible: it was dirty, unsafe, unhygienic and overal very small for the price. The host ‘Laura’ was very unhelpful and kept being defensive and unresponsive, she only wanted to message on WhatsApp and not Airbnb. Laura has been hosting for 2 years and she has an Airbnb in Gzira. Don’t make the same mistake as I did and don’t book from her. I wasted 2 days trying to get my money back and get a new place to stay. The costumer service promised to pay me 20% of the money for the hotel that I booked to stay for the time being. However they later called me and told me they cannot pay it because we booked it with my friends name even though we told them multiple times that we are together and told them our names via call and messages. They did not tell us that we had to book with the same name. Furthermore, they did not provide us with a new place to stay. That we had to do ourselves. Now I’ve wasted 2 days of my vacation trying to fix the problems THEY created for me. Do not use an Airbnb. Just stick with a hotel, it’s less stressful and they will always be more helpful than the Airbnb costumer service. Overall, I would not recommend booking with Airbnb because they’re not helpful and it will cause more stress in your vacation than sticking with a hotel.",1

Unfair Damage Charge and Unsafe Accommodation – Very Disappointed with Airbnb,"I booked a property in London via Airbnb and had an extremely frustrating and unfair experience.One of the beds in the property was visibly worn out and already damaged before we arrived. Despite using it normally, the bed collapsed during our stay  clearly due to poor maintenance and pre-existing structural issues. Instead of acknowledging this, the host filed a damage claim for over £400, which is absolutely unreasonable for such a cheap and old bed.I explained the situation to Airbnb, including that the damage was not caused by misuse and that the item was already unsafe. However, Airbnb sided with the host without proper investigation. I wasn’t even aware I had to photograph furniture defects on arrival to protect myself which is an unreasonable expectation.This whole process has been stressful, unfair, and has made me lose trust in Airbnb’s support system. I will not be using Airbnb again and would advise others to be very cautious document every little thing the moment you check in, or you might get charged for things that aren’t your fault.",1
If I could give 0 stars I would,"If I could give 0 stars I would. We reserved a lodge for 8 people with a whirlpool 8 months in advance. Cancelled last minute and Airbnb suggested alternatives: a) a pitch for a tent for 2 people or b) a pitch for a tent for 2 people. Notably, both are more expensive that the initial deposit. Conveniently alternatives have gone up but over £1000, from which they will pocket £200 a pop. Spent the whole day back and forth with customer support who acted as if they would help, asking to choose an alternative and provide links etc, only to finally be told they can give max £95. Absolute joke and definitely deliberate, the same thing happened last year.Avoid at all cost",1
Don't book through Airbnb,"Absolutely awful support from airbnb. We stayed in an apartment in Albufeira hosted by Joaquim (stay away) and were accused by this host of losing a set of keys which was not the case as we left both sets in the apartment. I didn't think to take a picture as evidence of this as it's not a normal thing to do and we trusted our hosts throughout the most part of our stay. The host requested through airbnb for me to pay £130 to replace the missing key. I appealed this but to no avail. The Airbnb support team did not help me in any way and were quick to side with the host. I repeatedly explained to them we had done nothing wrong and how the hosts representative who came to see us out of the apartment was intimidating towards us and seemed to have a lot of keys in his hands and pockets. Their reason for supporting the hosts claim was that he reported the issue timely which had nothing to do with the situation and their messages and emails were very contradicting saying we had to pay for the ""damage we made to the property"". We made no damage whatsoever to the hosts property. it felt like the airbnb support team just weren't listening to my side of the situation or even trying to understand the situation.

Occasionally, I receive them via SMS, but the email with the actual password reset link? Completely missing. I’ve tried multiple times, from different devices and networks. Nothing. So now Airbnb is holding money that I cannot access because Payoneer’s system is broken and there’s absolutely no customer support worth mentioning.Payoneer is unreliable, outdated, and completely user-hostile. And Airbnb is no better — they’ve partnered with this dysfunctional platform and leave hosts stranded when there’s a problem.

Worst support ever experienced,"Worst support ever experienced. First they falsely promise that everything is fine and sorted out, but literally one month later charge me for a booking extension that was cancelled and sorted out with the host, with multiple calls and conversations with both support and the host proving so.

Absolute scammers.",1
Misleading app design and empty customer support promises,"I booked a stay through Airbnb after searching for rentals in a specific city. One listing appeared relevant, but only after booking did I realize it was located almost two hours away. The app didn’t clearly label it as being in a different town—it just said “Villa in [Name X],” which I assumed was a creative name chosen by the host for their rental, not the name of an entirely different location.For users unfamiliar with the area, this is incredibly misleading. Airbnb shouldn’t mix listings from distant cities into a search without explicit labels and distance indicators. It’s unreasonable to expect users to research every name shown to check if it’s in the actual city they searched for and more when every other listing is in the searched area.When I raised this issue, customer support responded with scripted messages about how much they value customers—but offered no real help. No cancellation option, no credit, no solution. Just polite words that solve nothing.This shows that Airbnb prioritizes appearances over action, and their platform design does not protect the user experience.",1
Horrible customer service,"We rented a home where the owner left a review that contained false information. We have been trying for almost a week now to have the review removed but have not had success, despite showing screen shots of our conversations with the host that prove what we are saying. Apparently there are only a couple reasons to remove reviews, and saying false or misleading information is not one of them. I've already been feeling wary of booking Airbnbs with the hassle compared to hotels, and this has sealed that for me. In addition to them not removing the review, it has been very hard to talk to anyone who knows what's going on. When I called and asked if someone could explain why the request to remove the review was denied, I was told it is impossible to talk to anyone on the team. That feels incredibly shady. I will not be using Airbnb from now on.",1

Misleading Refund Policy (PLUF),"I booked a listing on Airbnb that promised a 50% refund if cancelled before August 25th 2025. I cancelled well within that timeframe, and was even told by an Airbnb support agent that I would receive a refund.But Airbnb later claimed that because I used their ""Pay Less Up Front"" option, the refund no longer applies. Their logic? That ""not paying the second half"" counts as a refund. This was never communicated during booking, and the cancellation policy never said refunds were conditional on full prepayment.I paid based on what I was shown and what was confirmed to me by their website. Now they're refusing to refund anything and have closed the case, every time I ask for further support, they refuse it.This is unfair, misleading, and unethical. Especially confirming the refund to a customer and days after changing their decision. Never seen anything like this. I’ve escalated the case to the European Consumer Centre and national consumer protection bodies. I will not use Airbnb again until they take responsibility.",1
As a long-standing Airbnb host who…,"As a long-standing Airbnb host who takes pride in maintaining a safe, respectful, and rule-abiding environment for guests, I’m extremely disappointed by Airbnb’s recent handling of a clear case of review abuse and policy violation.A guest stayed at my property in early July and violated several house rules, including bringing an unregistered overnight guest, misusing restricted areas, and providing false information when asked. I enforced the rules professionally and requested the additional guest fee, as Airbnb allows. Only after that did the guest leave a negative review, claiming an alleged noise disturbance (which was never raised during the stay) and falsely stating they had “no access” to the kitchen — despite having been reminded of house rules after misuse.This is a textbook example of a retaliatory and misleading review, which Airbnb’s own Review Policy clearly prohibits. I submitted a thorough appeal outlining the timeline, referencing another guest’s 5-star review from the same dates, and offered to submit CCTV and message logs. Despite this, Airbnb refused to remove the review.To make matters worse, Airbnb has refused to explain why the review was allowed to stay. No specific reason was given, and no reference to their policy was cited — only a generic rejection message claiming the issue had already been reviewed. The support process was opaque and dismissive, with agents increasingly refusing to give names, likely to avoid accountability.The last named case manager I spoke with, Giuseppe, openly admitted he didn’t know the review policy and had to place me on hold to look it up — only to then read it back to me verbatim. I have full documentation of these conversations, which clearly show a lack of knowledge, consistency, and fairness.In summary:•	Airbnb does not enforce its own review policy•	Hosts are punished for enforcing Airbnb’s guest rules•	Support is unhelpful, unaccountable, and evasive•	Case closures happen without proper review or explanationThis experience has seriously damaged my trust in Airbnb’s ability to protect its hosts. I strongly caution fellow hosts: if a guest leaves an unfair or retaliatory review, you may be left completely unprotected — even with evidence.",1
Horrible customer service,"I booked an Airbnb, the host was unresponsive and we were left to wait outside at night for over an hour. When we called Airbnb they recommended that we go to a cafe to wait when it was 11pm at night. I asked them to arrange an alternative like a hotel they didn’t help at all. Later they eventually issued a refund the next morning. But they clearly don’t care about the safety of their customers, especially as we were two young women. Very horrible experience wouldn’t recommend if travelling as a group of females or young children, especially not at night.When the host arrived later, he was racist and threatened to evict us at night. Despite his hostility his ad still remains on Airbnb to this day. Terrible and don’t care about their customers.",1

I Was Failed by Airbnb—Safety Ignored and False Claims Upheld,"I’ve been an Airbnb host for years, welcoming guests from around the world and consistently earning only 5-star reviews. That changed during a recent, deeply distressing incident, where I was forced to ask Airbnb to remove a guest from my home due to inappropriate and intrusive behaviour that made those in the household genuinely fear for their safety.Airbnb’s own Safety Team intervened and had the guest leave early. Yet, despite clear evidence and Airbnb’s involvement, the guest was allowed to leave a blatantly retaliatory 1-star review. After weeks of appeals, Airbnb repeatedly denied my requests for removal—citing general “policy.” Now, only after I exhausted every avenue, Airbnb shifted position and introduced new allegations of “privacy violations” and “inaccuracies in the listing,” claims that were never mentioned at any earlier stage, and which are simply false.Allowing a removed guest to publish a misleading review—then retroactively justifying it with unsubstantiated counterclaims—feels like a deliberate attempt to silence legitimate concerns and protect the platform, not the host. This process has been demoralising and deeply unfair.I urge Airbnb to take host safety seriously, follow their own policies, and provide real protections for those who uphold high standards. Until then, hosts and guests should know: acting in good faith and prioritising safety does not guarantee Airbnb’s support—or even protection from reputational harm.",1

Absolutely no protection for consumers,"Absolutely no protection for consumers.I recently booked an Airbnb at Great Yarmouth. Upon arrival it was pretty clear that the property was not safe - as evidenced by later research I did on crimerate.co.uk, which showed the address to be within 150 meters of dozens of violent crimes over the past year. The place was also filthy, but that was of less importance than the dangerous position. I did not even stay the night; the parking space for this pit was around the back of the building and (again according to the website crimerate.co.uk) was the site of several B&E offences as well as criminal damage in the last 12 months.Despite the genuinely very dangerous position of this Airbnb, the disgusting conditions it was in, and the missing amenities necessary for an Airbnb (there was no oven glove! An oven but no glove! Are you kidding?), Airbnb has given me no support in receiving even a slight refund from the host. They do not think the dozen or so sexual misdemeanours which took place directly behind the building constitute unsafe conditions, nor do they think a freezer drawer being *brown* with filth is unhygienic.I had previously had two positive stays in Airbnbs, but it seems I got lucky with them.

The apartment did not meet expectations in any way – neither in standard nor in relation to the high price.Here are some of the most serious issues:🧼 Cleanliness and hygiene:– Blood stains on the bed linen– Dirty and partly torn bath towels (and no clean ones provided)– No hand towels or kitchen towels available– Urine splashes on the bathroom floor– Wet, used cleaning cloths stuffed into a cabinet– Old food left in the fridge and dirty dishes in the kitchen– Greasy surfaces, sticky cupboards, and dusty furniture– Coffee grounds still in the coffee machine upon arrival🌡️ Indoor climate and comfort:– No air conditioning and no fan available – the apartment became unbearably hot at night– No curtains in the living room to block sunlight– The stovetop was locked with no instructions, making it impossible to cook (despite us clearly stating that we were traveling with kids and needed to prepare meals)🚗 Parking confusion and financial loss:Before our arrival, we explicitly asked where to park. The listing said street parking was available, but everything was marked “Private Parking” with no clear guidance.We received no reply, and unfortunately ended up with a parking ticket costing around 1,000 DKK. The host completely ignored this issue and never acknowledged it – let alone offered to help or reimburse us.The host's response only made things worse:We reached out to the host right away with a detailed list of the issues, requesting urgent cleaning and reasonable compensation. The reply we received was a few short, dismissive lines – no apology, no solution. Cleaning was promised, but several hours later we were informed there was only one key – and we had it with us. When we explained that we had gone out for the day with the children and had clearly stated a time window for access, the host responded by claiming that we were being uncooperative and that help was therefore withdrawn. This was an extremely manipulative and passive-aggressive use of power dynamics.To top it off, before departure we received a message from the host stressing the importance of us leaving the apartment “in the same fine condition as we found it(!)”The whole situation felt calculated and insincere.🌟 The only positive part of our experience was Airbnb’s customer service. We received prompt, professional, and trustworthy help – special thanks to Mike and the team.We have documented everything with around 20 photos and saved all communication with the host. If you wish to see this, feel free to reach out to andreas.oberg2(at)gmail.comIn summary: Avoid this listing. The apartment was substandard, the host was unprofessional, and the entire experience ruined the start of our vacation.",1
"The best, but not perfect.","If you are booking an apartment, Airbnb is  the best option available but only if you choose a reputable/reliable host.The accommodation standard can vary but that is the nature of booking a 'home away from home'.Choose the correct accommodation for your needs/budget and the platform is as good as it gets.",4
You don't get refunded from AirBnB,"Be Aware! The booking process for AirBnB is that you find accommodation which you want to book, pay upfront, and then the host has 24 hours to respond. If the host doesn't respond, you would think that you would receive your money back. But no, despite reading that this would be the case, they only reimbursed me in the form of credits. So now, I have to use AirBnB to book my accommodation, which is wrong because my second choice apartment is not on AirBnB. On a positive note, the online help centre support staff were very polite, full of nice platitudes, but ultimately, they couldn't provide a solution. I was lucky because I was only booking for two nights so the amount isn't big, but nonetheless, they are refusing to transfer the monies back to my bank account. Unfair, I feel robbed and I am stuck with credits instead of my hard earned cash. Disappointing.",1
Payment cancellation after host decline,"Placed a reservation, and paid via Visa credit card. The Airbnb host did not respond, and reservation was cancelled.The visa authorisation request was not cancelled and is now on hold for 10 days  until the card issuer expire the request, leaving with a maxed creditcard limit, and difficulties to book another location. Insanity, support was less than helpful and points finger to issuer, called issuer and they point to Airbnb.",1

First of all, I didn't, second, this is defamatory and false, third:it is also irrelevant since I paid a cleaning fee and the host was happy to take in another guest right after. Airbnb refused to take the review down. So I am promised a cleaning service included in my price, and I get defamed publicly for not leaving the place as pristine as a cleaning lady would. So I am promised a service, and I am publicly humiliated, and Airbnb does not protect me.",1

Disappointing Experience with Airbnb…,"Disappointing Experience with Airbnb Hosts and Support — Unresolved Issue and Lack of CommunicationI want to share my recent experience with Airbnb that has left me extremely disappointed and feeling deceived. My reservation was made in December 2024 for an event in July 2025. In July, I inquired about parking but was told the property was no longer listed, and it was taken down months earlier—something I was never informed of by either the host or Airbnb.The lack of communication prevented me from finding a suitable replacement, which was impossible given the timing and event. I contacted Airbnb support, expecting fair resolution, but was only offered a refund of about $80—a mere 20% of my initial nearly $700 reservation—and then later a $200 credit, which is inadequate given the circumstances.This experience has made me feel misled both by the host, who should have notified guests of the listing’s removal earlier, and by Airbnb support, which provided insufficient compensation for a situation that caused significant inconvenience and potential risk.Because of this, I regret to say I will not use Airbnb services again. I believe transparency and fair customer service are crucial, and sadly, my experience fell far short.I hope sharing this helps others make informed decisions.",1
PLEASE just book a hotel during vaction and stay away from airbnb,"To be short, I honestly do not recommend because if anything in the house happens to not working/broken, you will be charged and left a negative review by the superhost.

If I were given a chance, I wouldve spent it on a hotel to at least make my vacation happy and joy. I wish any bro reading this will not get into the same situation.",1
Airbnb is a TERRIBLE service,Airbnb is a TERRIBLE service. There are tons of little tricks they do to scam you. We got scammed by a cancellation policy that changed before and after booking. Do NOT trust them.,1
Deliberately poor communication to extract money from users,"Airbnb cancelled our trip after a failed payment reminder went to an old email and we lost a £5600 deposit (taking this up with the bank). I hold my hand up to this email issue, but there was no sms, no call, no in-app message. Considering I have to receive a text message to log-in, this seems like a deliberate policy to extract money because of a simple mistake. I was quick to receive an in-app support message declining my requested refund, but they can’t contact me by any other method than email to solve a card issue that would then take 5 mins to sort?",1
Airbnb Support Failed Us as Superhosts,"As Superhosts with a 5-star track record, we were left deeply disappointed by Airbnb’s handling of a retaliatory guest review.A guest who violated our clearly stated house rules (1-person booking, no visitors) was reminded politely of those terms. He responded with a 3-star review that had nothing to do with the stay itself — instead, it reflected frustration about not being allowed to break the rules.We submitted evidence, including house rules and message history, and asked Airbnb to remove the review based on their own Review Policy, which prohibits retaliation and irrelevant content. Instead of a fair review by Trust & Safety, Airbnb support repeatedly pushed us to refile the same form, creating a loop that blocks real resolution.We were told that even as Superhosts, we couldn’t escalate — despite policy violations being clearly present.Airbnb’s internal support structure seems designed to protect the review system at all costs, even when hosts are unfairly targeted.We love hosting, and we take pride in our space and our guest experience. But Airbnb's refusal to review a harmful, retaliatory review fairly has hurt our listing — and our trust in the platform.",1
Wasted a lot of time speaking with Airbnb support!,"Not happy with recent experiences. There are two actually. Let's talk about first one, cancelled a reservation but left luggage inside. Host insisted me to book for another 5 nights (minimum stay requirement) just to get my luggage back, costing me a total of 250£! Obviously, I refused to comply, called airbnb support, talked for hours no solution, had to stay the night outside, with luggage trapped inside host's house. Went there the next morning, host insisted they will ship my luggage. At the end, had to pay 49£ handling fees just to get it shipped. Airbnb offered no compensation nothing.Second time, got charged single occupancy tax of 45£, just because I am staying alone at the property. Charges didn't show up during payment. But it was magically listed somewhere in the listing itself and need to be paid AFTERWARDS. Hmm interesting... Airbnb again offered no support sided with the host. So yeah poor experience!",1
My worst accomadation experience ever…,"My worst accomadation experience ever was with Airbnb. My first and last Time using this company for sure. Booked an apartmet and when I entered the apartmet I noticed a big problem and start to contact host and Airbnb about solution. Well I was told by Airbnb to book a hotel room for the night, since it was impossible to stay the night at the apartmet. I was told I will Be refunded the money back from the hotel room. Well the next Day the fight for my money back started and boy what a fight its Been. I have been talking with more than 10 different customer service person from Airbnb and anyone is giving me answers and I have been called a liar , even thought I have pictures and videos for prove about the problems in the apartmet. This has been most horrible experience with accomadation ever and is yet to be solved. The fight continues. But I must say, avoid using Airbnb at all cost. Total scam company.",1
Unethical Practices,"To whom ever reads this beware staying at Airbnb.com properties.  If the owner accuses you of breaking something even if you did it or not or something breaks because it’s old and worn out it’s Airbnb.com’s policy to side with the host no matter what occurred.  So you can ultimately pay for your stay and then get charged to fix an item on top of that.  I get it if it was done maliciously yes you should be charged but not for regular maintenance to the property or if you didn’t break the item.  Airbnb.com has a process to appeal the decision but it’s all for show, they will always side with the host.  It’s unethical practices that Airbnb.com does.  This is my opinion, stay at Airbnb.com properties it’s your money but I’m done with the company.",1
"Evicted Without Warning After 7 Years on Airbnb — No Explanation, No Support","I’ve been using Airbnb for seven years and maintained a 4.5-star rating as both guest and host. Until recently, I had no major issues. But what happened in Encarnación, Paraguay was so poorly handled that I can no longer trust the platform.I booked an apartment with a host named José, who never contacted me directly. All communication was outsourced to a building manager who gave confusing check-in instructions — we got lost. I requested two sets of keys for myself and my girlfriend but was told there was only one and it couldn’t be duplicated.The building was far from the city center. After a disagreement, my partner left with the only key. The manager refused to help, and I had to ask neighbors to get back in. Three days later, Airbnb suddenly canceled my reservation and removed me from the listing without any warning, explanation, or opportunity to respond.When I contacted the manager, she vaguely mentioned “complaints” — likely about noise — but I was never warned, never approached, and never allowed to explain myself. I was told at 2:00 PM that I had to leave by 6:00 PM. With no transportation and little time, I had to move in a rush. At 6:30 PM, the building manager called the police to force me out. I lost valuable belongings, including a wallet with ID and cards and a charger.Airbnb has refused to say what was reported. And now I’ve been banned entirely from the platform. After seven years and a near-perfect rating, I was cut off without due process or recourse.I’ve filed a complaint with SEDECO (consumer protection in Paraguay) and am exploring legal action. I’ve also alerted the BBB, Trustpilot, ScamAdvisor, and other international groups.Airbnb’s customer service is infamous for a reason:•	1.3 stars on Trustpilot•	1.2 stars on Consumer Affairs•	1.06 stars on BBBI now use Booking.com and connect directly with hosts. If you’re a digital nomad or long-term traveler, be warned: Airbnb does not protect guests, even loyal ones.",1

Discrimination,"I need to share my frustrating and disappointing experience with @Airbnb’s customer service.🧵 THREAD — Here's what happened 👇1️⃣ I purchased 10 x £100 Airbnb gift cards and redeemed all of them via the Airbnb app.2️⃣ But in the end, only £900 appeared in my account.3️⃣ I double-checked everything. All 10 codes were correct and fully redeemed. I even contacted the gift card provider, who confirmed that all cards had been successfully used — no issues on their end.4️⃣ So I contacted @Airbnb support to investigate. But instead of helping, they repeatedly told me I had only redeemed 9 cards. I explained the situation many times — they clearly weren't reading the history.5️⃣ Then it got worse.In two separate replies, Airbnb addressed me by the wrong name:— First they called me ""Man Chicken"" (my real name is Man Pui).— Then they called me ""Pauline"".6️⃣ This is incredibly disrespectful. Not only do they ignore my actual issue, they also misname me twice, showing a complete lack of care or professionalism.7️⃣ I've spent hours trying to get Airbnb to properly investigate, but I keep getting copy-paste responses, and no resolution.8️⃣ This experience feels discriminatory, frustrating, and dismissive.

Covering up hosts committing fraud,"Supporting and covering up hosts committing fraud.Upon arrival at the property the host told me that €300 deposit needed to be taken to make sure the property was returned clean, tidy and with no damage.No mention of this in the listing when I raised this issue the host denied it. Despite there being a notice on the wall of the property, stating the €300 deposit would not be returned if we don’t do a face-to-face check out handover the keys.Airbnb were scared of losing the host so they sided with him on this issue.Secondly, we were charged €30 for using the second bed in a two bed property which we confirmed two people would be staying in.Airbnb sided with us on this case, however didn’t take the €30 off of the host, instead paid it themselves not to upset them.",1
Airbnb Failed Me Completely – Dangerous and Dishonest Host Protected,"I’ve been using Airbnb for years, but after my last experience in Vitré, France, I’ve completely lost trust in the platform.The apartment I stayed in was in appalling condition. There was a persistent, sickening mold smell throughout the house. The air conditioning unit didn’t work properly because the filter was completely clogged with dust I had to clean it myself just to get it running. The towels provided were filthy and stained. I had to pay out of pocket to wash them. Despite the listing clearly stating Wi-Fi was available, there was no connection and since I was working remotely, I had to pay to work from another location.Worst of all, we heard rats crawling in the walls at night. It was impossible to sleep. The house was not just dirty it was a sanitary hazard. The garden was overgrown and filled with weeds, the trash bins were full when we arrived, and there were cobwebs and dust in every corner. The kitchen sponge was moldy and unusable. The smell inside the house was so bad that it made it hard to breathe.Despite all of this, I decided to leave a polite and moderate review, because I didn’t want to deal with drama or potential retaliation while I was still staying there. That was a mistake. The host retaliated by leaving a false and offensive review accusing me of being unclean a complete reversal of reality.I contacted Airbnb immediately, expecting support. Instead, they told me that because I didn’t file a complaint within 72 hours of check-in, there was nothing they could do. This policy is absolutely outrageous. It ignores the real risks of being stuck in a property where you fear confrontation or retaliation. It assumes that all problems can and should be reported immediately even when you’re still locked into a stay and vulnerable.Airbnb’s refusal to remove the false review, or take any action against the host, shows how broken their system is. They claim to value guest safety, but in reality, they protect hosts even dishonest and negligent ones over paying guests who are just trying to have a decent experience.This was not just an inconvenience. It was a fraudulent listing, a toxic environment, and a failure of Airbnb’s duty of care. I no longer feel safe using this platform, and I will not be booking through Airbnb again. If you care about your health, safety, and dignity as a traveler, I suggest you think twice.",1
Process was followed and stay was cancelled,"Made payment 3 months ago, my stay was then cancelled, by the platform, well past the deadline for full refund and only a few days before check-in.I had to arrange for a stay elsewhere, and paid from my pocket, for a last minute check-in, exhorbitant fees.It was Airbnb's fault, not the host, and they still haven't refunded me.",1
I don’t usually leave negative reviews,"I don’t usually leave negative reviews, but my experience with Airbnb deserves to be shared. From start to finish, this was one of the most frustrating customer service experiences I’ve had with any company.My frustration started when I tried to book the first property, the listing had a price for the dates I booked however in the process I was asked what the reason was for my stay? Now I figured this question was simply to block people from having parties and what not so I responded we were visting elderly family in the area and since it would be football season might attend a game, if the local team had a home game that weekend and it would be easier to get them to the game from there. The property already had a price listed but was then told if I made the reservation and it was announced their was a home game I would be required to pay them more money or have my rservation canceled. I decided to look elsewhere as to me this is simply price gouging and taken advantage of people. I then completed a booking at another location that asked no questions and had a confirmed booking. Two weeks later NFL schedule was announced and sure enough there would be a game that weekend. Well fast forward another month and I get an alert that my Airbnb was cancelled. I reached out to the host hoping it was a mistake and was told there was an error on Airbnb's side and I could go ahead and  rebook, well when I did the same host raised the booking almost $750, I messaged them again and was told along the lines of oh well thats the price now, book it or don't. I contacted Airbnb support immediately expecting help, but what I got instead was a series of copy-and-paste responses, endless back-and-forth emails, and a complete lack of accountability. It felt like no one actually read my messages or took my concerns seriously.I was bounced between multiple agents who all asked me to “be patient” while doing absolutely nothing. When I finally received a response, they sided with the host, and said their host can cancel at anytime up to check in for any reason as it is their property. Again understandable in some circumstances but since the listing was misrepresented and the host only cancelled to jack up the price seemed to be unfair and very unsettling.I expected Airbnb to protect its guests, but instead, I was left to deal with a bad situation on my own. Their “support” system is disorganized, slow, and ultimately useless.This experience has completely ruined my trust in Airbnb. I’ll be looking elsewhere for travel accommodations in the future, never again using this site — and I suggest others do the same.",1
very expensive with lots of hidden charges,"so many hidden charges and cleaning fees !!!! you pay to stay in the property, then you pay again to have the property cleaned, one property wanted me to wash the bed linen and towels after I paid a cleaning fee!!!!

SCAM: Don't join as a Fitness Host,"I signed up for Airbnb’s $500 Host Reward program after receiving their promotion targeted at new hosts. As a fitness business owner, I was excited to list my space and followed every single step they asked for — timely setup, profile completion, multiple follow-ups, even direct emails to Airbnb support.After weeks of delays, unclear communication, and waiting on approvals, I’ve now been told I “don’t qualify” for the reward. No clear reason, no accountability. Just a waste of time and energy.This program feels like a bait-and-switch — especially for people in fitness or wellness who were specifically encouraged to join. I feel completely scammed, and I won’t be using Airbnb again as a host or a guest. If you're in the fitness industry, do not waste your time. Airbnb is not set up to support us and they don’t stand by their own promotions.",1

It stunk I had to walk through fag ends and used cotton buds to park the car and get into the stylish flat, could not use the kitchen with the filth it goes on and on, if Airbnb gives any thought to the paying guests you will look into this, you have cheated me and put me into a filthy ghetto. They won't show the outside of the property because they would never rent it, I can still smell the stink and filth. If you want to see the photos of the place  i took then let me know . airbnb needs to send someone to look at this place and stop the deceit. You owe me that money back.",1
Airbnb failures,"Airbnb must take responsibility for its guests. Hosts are allowed to post misleading or heavily photoshopped pictures and vague descriptions of their properties. When guests arrive and find the property doesn’t match their expectations, they risk losing money if they cancel. This practice is illegal under UK trading standards laws.Additionally, Airbnb needs to change its policy regarding payment collection. Guests should not be charged before the host confirms the booking. If the property is unavailable after booking, guests may wait up to 15 working days for a refund, which unfairly disadvantages them.Moreover, Airbnb must enforce stricter requirements for hosts to accurately list the location of their properties, including whether they are situated on a council estate. Hosts should also be mandated to provide photos of the property's exterior and details regarding accessibility. These changes are essential to protect guests and ensure transparency within the platform.",1
We will not use Airbnb again,"Our experience was not the end of the world, but we will never book again with Airbnb.  We had a comfortable 5 night stay in an apartment in San Diego, CA, and after we returned home we received a message from our host claiming damages for blood stains on the linens.  We are old and live in Hawaii, so we have issues with our skin.  We pre-treated the linens with cold water before departing and assumed that the host or his cleaner was knowledgeable enough to take it from there.  We travel alot all over the USA and the globe, and have never had anyone have any issues with this. Thank goodness we were only charged $105.40, but we felt the fault lay in improper cleaning, probably with hot water.  Neither Airbnb nor the host made any concessions, and after disputing the charge with them and our credit card, it was too late to alter our positive review.  We will not use Airbnb again in the future.",1
Beware of Airbnb and Host Evolve,"Title: Disappointed by Airbnb’s Refund Policy and Customer ServiceI made a reservation on Airbnb by mistake and realized it almost immediately. I canceled the booking within 15 minutes, expecting a full refund—especially since no harm or inconvenience was caused to the host. To my surprise, Airbnb refused to issue a refund, citing the host’s cancellation policy.I understand policies exist, but this was clearly an honest mistake, corrected within minutes. What’s more disappointing is the lack of flexibility and empathy from Airbnb’s customer support. I reached out hoping for a reasonable resolution, but was met with a rigid response and no real effort to help.As a long-time user of Airbnb, this experience has left me questioning the platform’s commitment to fairness and customer care. I hope Airbnb reconsiders how it handles situations like this in the future.",1
Charged nearly $200 for Damage We Did Not Do,"We have booked many stays through Air B and B. Our last one was our last one we will ever use. That is when we realized there is no one to go to when problems arise from an abusive and lying host. A host can literally make up a bucket of lies and also post a very damaging and false review of a guest (which one did of us) and nothing is done. We were billed 2 weeks after our stay $179 for things we did not break and items not even in the house! Here is the list of lies we were billed for: $50 extra cleaning (I spent over an hour cleaning the place. We slept in only 1 room out of 3. Cleaned bathroom thoroughly. Wiped down living room, dining area, and kitchen. Put towels in tub (used dog towels from closet as the host left us no towels). We rented that place because the host listed it as within walking distance to a major event in Kansas City. The walk was a 2-mile walk across four lanes of a busy highway, returning at night in an unsafe area. It was rather terrifying for us. My husband made it across the traffic but I nearly fell in front of a truck and returned to my side of the busy 4-lane highway. A homeless man came up to me and stood telling me to just go out into the traffic. It took me about 5 minutes to be able to get across the highway. This ruined our night since we knew we had to repeat that walk to get back to the house. You had to cross a huge empty parking lot, cross the full one as well, enter a graffiti tunnel with a blind curve, go up 2 flights of old concrete stairs, cross a walking bridge, all this while it was 95 degrees. Two people followed us down the dark sidewalk and no sidewalk in one place by a deserted house. Next we were billed $80 for breaking a 40-year-old dishwasher that had an old knob. We never used the thing. There was no dish soap in the house and no dishwasher soap. No dish cloths either. Next we were billed $40 for broken and dirty dishes. She put a photo of some ceramic dish that we never even saw in the house. She put a photo of some pan that needed to be washed. The Air B and B help was no help. I did 2 appeals and they sided with the host. We realized a host could put anything and bill a guest. We looked up reviews and this very thing was prevalent. Some guests were charged hundreds and even $1000 for things they did not break. One person was charged for new floor in the house. Another was charged for a new shower. A relative of ours was charged $1000 for damage but thankfully their credit card reversed charges. The house we were in smelled like a kennel. The host had throws on the couch which was urine soaked from dogs. Lastly, there was a party in the basement until I complained at 2:00 a.m. The host was one of the people in the basement making the noise. She wrote a negative review of us telling an absolute lie -that we had told her up front - let us stay free or we will write a bad review. How can they allow such lies to remain. I contested the review but Air B and B said it will remain, and it did -the only negative review of us in all these year. The other many reviews on us state the same thing: Nice couple. Very sweet. Left our place very clean. Left our place spotless. That is because we are nice and we do clean the places better than when we arrived since we used to be a host. Will never book through Air B and B again. You cannot delete your own account. You have to request that they delete it. Ours is still up. We will have to contact our credit card company to tell them we do not agree to any more charges. There is no oversight.  We once stayed and cut short a week stay at a place that made you put used toilet paper in a bucket. Another place had no bathroom although it said it did. There was a toilet and no sink in the bedroom. Another was in a horrible neighborhood in a big city and it had an old camper right outside on blocks with people staying in it. There was a chop shop of sorts up against the little house we stayed in. Saws and drills went all night long in it. Another place in Colorado had a honey pot and no bathroom. My husband was not happy about that one.  There was no bed either, just a pull-out couch. We pulled the thin mattress off onto the floor. Still could not sleep on it. Was a remote place in the mountains, so stuck for the night. But my main complaint is the risk of being billed for things you did not do and lies being allowed to stick about you. I have been fighting this for 5 weeks now. I give up! Never will I ever use Air B and B again. And we loved them for so long.",1
As a long-time top-rated host in Milan,"As a long-time top-rated host in Milan, Italy, I’m extremely disappointed by Airbnb's current policies and treatment of hosts.After more than 200 five-star reviews and years of offering experiences on the platform, I have lost all trust in Airbnb. For over 8 months, I’ve been waiting for a pending payment that Airbnb has failed to resolve. Despite sending over 10 messages to Airbnb support, every reply ends with the same generic message:""Thanks for taking the time to reach out. I'm going to forward your case to a member of our team who's in a better position to resolve this for you... this thread will close..."" — and nothing happens.Airbnb charges hosts more than 20% while manipulating listing visibility, encouraging hosts to create new listings instead of supporting the ones they’ve built and earned trust on. This seems to be a tactic to gain more from commissions, at the expense of the hosts' efforts and reputation.To me, this is not just poor customer service — it’s a complete lack of empathy, responsibility, and integrity.I will never use Airbnb again, whether for experiences or property rentals. Airbnb has made it clear that profit comes before people.",1
What a waste of time  and effort,"I purchased 2 gift cards with points from my Revolut.I could not claim those where I am resident for some reason - probably to do with fact that I have changed countries since opening my ABNB account.Somehow it took XX many different customer agents days and a number of calls, some of which at 11pm and 1:30am because nobody cared to check which time zone I am in, to just about figure half a solution / explanation to issue.Bad comms, bad English, not thinking or passing full info down to next person, and, overall, way too much effort to claim way too little money because of investigating someone who has spent many thousands over the 10 years I have been on this platform.

NO.the nasty review remains.Truth / reality is irrelevant to Airbnb investigators.FYI, if u think the guest reservation side is bad, the host side is a HORROR.  In the host calendar, I set a price then the guest was charged 3x LESS than listed.VRBO is far worse, if you can imagine that.",1
Warning from airbnb,"🚨 WARNING – Airbnb Booking Scam in Florianópolis, BrazilI was charged $1,050 USD for a reservation I cancelled BEFORE check-in. I never stayed at the apartment, not even for a minute — and the host refused any refund. Airbnb said the refund is up to the host, and they won’t help.This is completely unfair.The listing is run by “Me2 Rentals” — beware, this is a trap!You can lose your money and receive nothing in return.❌ No flexibility❌ No protection❌ No accountability#AirbnbWarning #Florianopolis",1

Destroyer of communities. That is Airbnb...,"I never used Airbnb, and I never will. But I feel like I want to vent because this company and its practices is one of the worst, most destructive business model that you find on this planet among us human beings. Purely a profit based, it drives housing cost up way too much. Those fortunate enough makes lot of money on Airbnb instead having regular tenants.At the same time, trash is littering the streets for tenants Airbnb. My mother had to move because of this nonsense.But you can not just blame Airbnb, the government is really slacking putting regulations on this company. It is OUT OF CONTROL!!Personally I wish this company to just vanish. But around the corner, there will be another profiteers ready to take over if they ever went bust. So this will NEVER go away.",1
Stay away from Airbnb,"Don’t know where to start - spend a day trying to sort out an issue with their support, and they kept running in circles, kept claiming that they have tried to call me - even though they haven’t - then said they couldn’t call me due to policies - so they lied about trying to call me - and then on and on and on. Asked them to delete my account … so whatever you do, use other means to find accommodation. And yes, I am in the travelling business and spend 25 weeks a year around the world …but not with them!",1
Zero support for Hosts,"Zeri support for hosts, we are left completely alone in the hands of guests that can blackmail and abuse of our hospitality with the pending sword of a bad review.

I had an awful experience with Airbnb…,"I had an awful experience with Airbnb where I was verbally abused (over Airbnb messenger) by a Airbnb host. Airbnb didn't accept my complaint.Airbnb read of my abuse by the Airbnb host and refused to give me a refund. They also tried to get me to pay a £50 cleaning fee when the Airbnb host lied and said I had a dog stay, and complained that she would have to take the washing to a dry cleaner as her son had dog allergies. All lies, and Airbnb is still on the hosts side?",1
I will never be a host again,"I’ve been a guest many times and always treated properties how I would treat my own. Unfortunately I had a family move into my apartment who did not. Having worked in the property industry for 10+ years I know this is always a risk. However, the support thereafter if this happens really tells you everything you need to know about the company. And unfortunately I have received little to none from Airbnb. I took photos the day before move in of the apartment which I provided to Airbnb. I then took photos and videos of the property once they helped contact the tenant to move them on. My photo being the toilet seat that was broken due to wear and tear to give you an idea. I was told on the chat and over the phone that they would not refund the guests due to the evidence I provided. They then went against their word and refunded the guest. I tried to escalate this twice, and it was closed twice at past midnight and 3am with no explanation as to why they refunded the guests even though I provided screenshots of them telling me they would not do this. They’ve just told me to fill in a reimbursement claim and they will see ‘what they can do’ and to ‘not worry’. It’s now been over their 96 hour policy to respond to these issues and I still haven’t received anything. I truly hope this review creates some action following the damages of over £1400 and the guest has been allowed to provide a 1 star review….truly don’t feel a valued customer and following this experience, once resolved and the current guest bookings go ahead, I will never use this company again.",1
DANGEROUS AND WORST EXPERIENCE,"Airbnb does NOT care about the people who rent from them nor do they care about providing safe places to stay!!! I rented from a property from a different site but this particular place I found from airbnb first. I found it cheaper and used a different site. Well my CHILD found a bag of DRUGS where the kid's toys, puzzles and board games are!!!! I took video and pictures. When I confronted the owner he told me this isn't the first time this has happened!!! He also told me he and his wife were the ones to clean my cabin!! What kind of place doesn't make sure DRUGS aren't in their cabins?! Well on top of that, there were wasps and wasp nests in the patio area, ants in the bathroom and kitchen, and wood railings that are unsafe and falling apart and there were wooden steps that completely fell apart!!! Even though I booked with a different site, I reached out to Airbnb to report this dangerous rental property and informed them I have videos and pictures of all the evidence but they didn't care.",1
Airbnb does not protect Hosts,"Airbnb does not look out for their Hosts.  I had a guest recently stay at my STR.  The guest had just pulled up to the house, and before he even gout out of his vehicle, a neighbor apparently pulled along side of the guest and warned him not to park where he was.  I later learned that that the guest and neighbor nearly got into a physical altercation.Well, after the altercation, the guest reached out to me through the Airbnb Messenger indicating he had an issue with a neighbor and decided to leave.  Before I reached out to the guest I reached out to neighbors to find out what happened and I this is when I learned that the guest apparently has anger issues.  I reached out to the guest to discuss the matter and after talking, he indicated he would pay for the 1 night; however, wanted a refund for the remaining days.  When I explained that his altercation has nothing to do with me and I could not refund him, he proved his anger issues and hung up and then reached out to Airbnb where he lied not only to them, but through his review and stated my STR appeared to be abandoned and rundown.  I reached out to Airbnb and requested that they remove the review as it was obviously a lie.  Airbnb said it fell with in there guidelines to keep it; therefore, it can not be removed.  With all my evidence such as Super host status and a 4.97 out of 5 star rating from 63 reviews prior to this guests review and the guest providing no evidence, it is absolutely horrible.  Airbnb relies on hosts, with no hosts, there would be no Airbnb.I have made several attempts to work this out with Airbnb with no success.  They say that there special team can not change there decision, and mind the fact that you can not speak with anyone in that team.  On some other forums, it has been said that Airbnb is no longer using humans to conduct the review of reviews and that they now use AI.Now I am concerned about a guest that booked my STR for nearly 3 moths as he is contractor doing work in the area.  I have been reading that some hosts have experienced these so called long stay guests making up stories to get full refunds.  What's next??If Airbnb reaches out to me and resolves this issue as they should, I will update this review.",1
Airbnb does not care about the hosts,"Airbnb does not care about the hosts. They only care about their commission. I had a guest who refused to provide their passport details (as it's required by law!) and Airbnb told me that if I cancel the reservation, I will have to face consequences. So basically they are asking me to go against the law!!Absolutely ridiculous. I will delist all my 3 properties.",1
My first time ever renting the host…,"My first time ever renting the host said that I was only her fourth person. I made specific questions in regards to parking. She either didn't truly know or she lied. But but she ends up reimbursing me period she had unworking air conditioner in 98° weather. She had glass table that was broken. She had no sheets for one of the beds. She did not have enough towels and per Airbnb. I did the review that was requested of me. I didn't even write it bad. She turned around and wrote a very horrible review about me saying that I basically kept complaining. I sent her a total of 5 emails. Because one I wanted her to know the table was broken. Before we got there, there was no sheets and the only other state I. Kept crushing was about the air conditioner so you can stay at a place that does not have proper working. Air in near 100° temperatures, you don't have the bedding and that microwave that doesn't work. You can ask several questions of your host and they turn around. Don't like the review you made about them.Even though you didn'tear them apart and they can write a horrible review about you and airbnb will not rectify it. My best advice to stay at a hotel. Do not use airbnb to my understanding.They have gone really downhill since they started.I will never use them again.",1
Airbnb Dispute: Forced Payment and Lack of Support,"We rented an apartment through Airbnb for our Rome vacation from June 23rd to 29th and were unfortunately scammed. The property is listed as ""Laura's house in Alborone"", and the host is Alessandro Pala. I later discovered that the previous guest, who rented the apartment a week before us, was also forced to pay for a curtain and a chair that they allegedly didn't damage. Regrettably, I only saw this review after we had returned home.The host applied the same tactic to us. There were eight of us in the house. Even though we didn't use the bathroom on the day he specified and we checked everything when we left, he claimed that water overflowed from the bathroom, damaging the floor below. He then illegally entered the apartment without our permission while we were out, supposedly to perform repairs, and demanded compensation. We only learned about this incident upon returning to the apartment. When I took photos of the bathrooms that same day, there was still dust visible on the door frames and the floor. It was clear that if the house had been flooded and cleaned as he claimed, all the dust would have been gone.When we told him we absolutely would not pay for something we didn't do and asked him to send us a video of the incident, he didn't respond to us for a week. He only filed a compensation claim after we returned to our home country. The pictures he uploaded only show the toilet and the floor, where very little water is visible. There are no pictures or videos of the overall bathroom area where our personal belongings were; I uploaded those myself. He only uploaded a video of the downstairs area, which he claimed had a water leak. Since very little water flows in the bathroom, there's no way it would overflow even if left running.Furthermore, he charged the previous guest for a chair and a curtain, and then he demanded the same amount from us, claiming we damaged a curtain and a chair. When we arrived, one of the chairs was already broken, but we didn't pay attention to it as it wasn't needed. However, we should have been more careful with such a malicious person. We are individuals in certain positions, yet we were forced to pay money in this way. I'm writing this in such detail so that others do not have to experience the same thing. It seems we need to act like an expert, performing a full property inspection and recording it, taking detailed videos for each day to avoid being victims like us. Despite sending a video of the apartment to Airbnb upon leaving, showing no problems with the curtains, we were still forced to pay compensation for them.He demanded approximately 1300 Euros from us for this. My trust in Airbnb is completely gone. The host will simply upload a general photo, claim he illegally entered the property to make repairs, and then take this money from us. He has a key to the apartment; he could easily wet a small area, take pictures with two people, and demand the same thing again.Despite my repeated objections, my requests for images and evidence from Airbnb and the host to prove the incident occurred during my stay, and even my demand to see the pictures uploaded by the host with their creation dates, my appeal was rejected without any consideration. As a result, I was forced to pay approximately 900 euro. More than the money itself, I am furious about being compelled to pay for something I did not do. If I had actually caused the alleged damage and been asked for even more money, I wouldn't be nearly as angry.Since Airbnb doesn't have an office in Turkey, I cannot take them to the Consumer Court. This was my first experience with Airbnb, based on positive reviews, and I've now realized that Airbnb enables people to be scammed out of their money and completely on the side of the homeowners. It's absolutely crucial to choose more professional and impartial applications and platforms.I waited for your dispute to be fully resolved on Airbnb before writing a review about the property but when I realized they weren't going to resolve it, I tried to write a review on what they said was the last day for comments. However, they then told me my review period had expired, and my review was not published. Not only will I never use this platform again, but I also wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",1
This is just one of many times Airbnb…,"This is just one of many times Airbnb has completely failed to support us as professional hosts. Most recently, a guest left a false and extremely serious accusation claiming we had hidden cameras — a criminal allegation with zero evidence. Airbnb refused to remove the review, even though it violates multiple parts of their own Review Policy.No investigation. No follow-up. No accountability.This isn’t an isolated incident. Over the past year, we’ve had dozens of situations where Airbnb sided with guests — even when they were clearly violating rules, lying, or damaging property. We’ve lost thousands of dollars in damages, refunds, and lost bookings, and Airbnb support has been nonexistent every single time.Airbnb likes to promote “community,” but the truth is: hosts are disposable. We take all the risk, and when something goes wrong, Airbnb turns its back.We are now moving our listings off the platform and warning other hosts: if you care about your business, your reputation, and your safety — don’t rely on Airbnb.",1
Can you trust Airbnb in their hosts?,I booked an apartment in Paris around March for an July 8th. Stay for 10 days. 3 weeks before I was supposed to go to Paris they sent me a cancellation notice. Even though I had paid. At the last minute. I was having to find another apartment with limited choices in the apartment I found is a dump and cost me more money. Airbnb needs to compensate us and find the host when they do that. I've used Airbnb for many years and I'm not going to use them anymore as their hosts decide to cancel at the last minute which is totally unacceptable and they have no compensation rules for the person that's booked the apartment and gets screwed out of it. I would never use Airbnb again. This is the second time this has happened with this company.,1
Unnecessary account removal,I have been using this platform for many years. Never had an issue. They sent me an email saying that someone is trying to access my account.

"Lack of maintenance, poor accountability in Poway, CA for Airbnb.com","We stayed at an Airbnb in Poway during our daughter’s post-surgical recovery from a major orthopedic operation (four full bone cuts to her pelvis and femur). She was completely immobile and in a wheelchair. Airbnb failed us.Of the 3 showers advertised, only 1 worked. The master only misted. The guest faucet never worked. The dishwasher tipped over—it wasn’t bolted. The sink didn’t drain. The laundry door was broken for 12 days, and our daughter has sound sensitivity.The pool was unusable—dirty daily, bees, filter failure. Our son couldn’t use it, despite it being his only outlet. The garage was listed both as included and not—but it was essential for wheelchair access.We were in constant contact with the host. We only contacted Airbnb 10 days in. They offered a $2,000 refund—then revoked it. Final decision blamed a guest count mistake (we told the host 4 people were staying).This was not a vacation—it was about helping our daughter heal. And Airbnb refused to take accountability.-Amazingly since posting complaint on Better Business Bureau, review on Trusted advisor.com and here, and also an email to the Airbnb executive team, Airbnb reached out and finally honored their $1500 original refund offer, and also added a $200 coupon on future trips (upon which we actually have one coming that had already been booked before this Poway, CA trip) on top of the $340 already refunded by host (total $2040 on a trip of $7500+, roughly 27% discount total). Not sure which complaint channel helped the most, or maybe it was simply all of them, but we finally got a reasonable refund and felt heard.",1
"Host canceled after approval, Airbnb ignored, child and I left on the street at night","My name is Jalil and I am a long-time Airbnb user. I requested to extend my stay, and the host confirmed the change. Due to a technical issue with my saved payment card (already expired), the payment didn't go through immediately, but I was ready to change the method the next morning.Instead, the host unilaterally canceled the extension **after confirming it**, without any timely notice. This left me and my child **on the street in a foreign country**, late at night, with luggage, looking for another place to stay. We only managed to settle at **2:30 AM** the next day. I submitted screenshots, timelines, host confirmation, chat logs — everything.Despite this, Airbnb **closed the appeal** and **refused to escalate** the case. Their system allowed the host to cancel without consequences, but held me accountable.This is not about money. It’s about **basic guest safety, accountability, and equal treatment**. Airbnb's handling of this case was not only unfair — it was dehumanizing.I urge Airbnb to fix this. And I ask others to be aware.",1

What a rip off by Airbnb and the host after our stay in Hawaii,"We stayed at this accommodation for three nights in May, and it was by far the worst experience we’ve ever had (4770 pepelani loop unit 207b). Do not stay here! So much better places available, with much more value for money and not a host that is after your money afterwards.When we arrived, the space smelled musty. There was construction going on in the apartment downstairs, which caused constant noise disturbance. The fridge made loud noises throughout the night, and everything felt sticky and unclean. Should we have reported this? At hindsight, yes. But we travelled the world from the Netherlands and we did not want this stay to ruin our holiday to the beautiful Hawaï island. Well this stay was ruined by the host, seaside properties and Airbnb afterwards.After our stay, we received a message by the host claiming we had left a stain on a wooden nightstand—and were charged ~600 USD for it.! Honestly we never even noticed it. We might have made a stain or not (there were many already). Certainly it was not damaged, broken or something that could not be fixed. Maybe it was done by cleaners/others before or after. this is something that could be fixed and not something you have to pay 600 for because you need to buy new ones. These hosts, along with Airbnb, seem to be motivated solely by making money afterwards. What a rip-off.",1
Bi-Polar landlord Tina. Be warned,"She was bi-polar. total micro-manager. I am a 55-year single male. My company, Gateway Investigations, has had an A+ rating with the BBB and a 5-star rating on Google. I left her my elderly parents phone number and one day when I wasn't feeling well, I told her I would be fine. AT 10 PM, she called my elderly mother to voice her concern - after she had already told me she wouldn't be renewing my lease. Did I leave two empty sardine cans in the trash. Yes. Did I park one inch onto the grass in front. Yes. Thats my fault. Did I spill some ink on her upholstered dining room chair - yes. I sent her $135 to reupholster four chairs. YES. Another chair had stains as well and I told her just tell me once and I will never make the same mistake again. She would come over and bang on doors morning, mid-day and nights with issues instead of just sending a simple text. Horrible experience and two of the other three AIR BNB residents in the house said the same thing. Awful. Did she ever reupholster the chairs/ NOPE. total money grab That shows her charcter. I arrived at midnight was walk in date and she gave me the wrong code. I had to call her about 5 time for her to wake up and give ne the correct code. No apology of course. And no TP in the bathroom.

Scammed by Host,"Scammed by Host – Airbnb Did Nothing to HelpI was charged £210 by a host who then refused to host me and told me to cancel via SMS outside Airbnb, clearly trying to avoid platform rules. They rebooked the property to someone else and kept my money.When I contacted Airbnb, I was told someone would call me — but nobody ever did. Instead, I received a generic message saying the case was closed and that a refund couldn’t be issued without host approval. No action was taken despite clear violations of Airbnb’s policies.The host was rude, openly dismissive, and said they would ignore my messages. Airbnb’s lack of accountability and refusal to protect guests is extremely disappointing. I’ve reported the situation to consumer protection and GDPR authorities.If you’re looking for support in case something goes wrong — don’t rely on Airbnb.

Superhost for Years — But Treated Terribly by Airbnb Support,"Superhost for Years — But Treated Terribly by Airbnb SupportI’ve been a loyal Airbnb Superhost for years, but my recent experience has been deeply disappointing and emotionally draining.A guest (on her first Airbnb stay) broke multiple house rules, left my home in a mess, created safety risks (including nearly starting a fire), and had to be removed with Airbnb’s direct involvement. Despite this, she was allowed to leave two dishonest and damaging reviews.Under Airbnb’s own review policy, I’m entitled to submit two removal requests per review — yet support repeatedly shut me down after my first request, wrongly stating the case was reviewed “twice” when I had only submitted one request per review for two different bookings.Worse still:•	I was called at 2:09 AM by Airbnb support, which is completely inappropriate.•	My support thread was closed prematurely, and I was met with copy-paste responses instead of real answers.•	I’ve asked multiple times how to properly submit my second removal request, and no one will help.As a Superhost, I expected to be treated with respect — especially after raising genuine safety concerns. Instead, I’ve been dismissed, ignored, and left emotionally exhausted from the ordeal.I’ve now had to escalate this publicly because private channels have failed. Airbnb must be held accountable when they ignore their own policies and fail to support the hosts that keep their platform running.",1
I am a property owner,"I am a property owner - a guest smashed a table, and I therefore asked for compensation from her - she refused, swore at me and verbally abused me via text despite photographic evidence throughout - and to add insult to injury, subsequently left a 1 star review, despite saying the house was spotless, immaculate and luxurious.  Air B and B have refused to remove this review.  As a host how can we claim against damages when the guests can ruin your business.  This is a 16 bed luxury beach house, and we break our backs to keep it to 5 star (all other 130 reviews are 5 star).  If you have a house that is your business, not a joke or pocket money, I suggest you go to The Big House Experience who also list this house - they are excellent.  I will be withdrawing this house from Air B and B at the end of the year, the second house I was going to list with them I will now not do so.  They should be ashamed - backing up a host should be very high on the priority list - and they have failed.  Its their loss as well as the large sum of commission they get from my guests in bookings fees.  Poor show Air B and B - I am out!",1
"Rude, Vicious, Threatening Host","I just had the worst Airbnb experience ever!! I booked a week-long stay at a cottage in Portland, OR. There were cobwebs, mildew, wet floors, a dead fly in the window, and a moldy piece of food on the floor. The whole place smelled musty. I should have documented everything and cancelled my trip, but I didn’t know any better. I stayed and cleaned it up.I left an honest review of my opinion and experiences. The host, Joanna G., is a malicious, unprofessional bully with serious anger issues. She was upset that I didn’t rate her five stars, so she sent a snarky, sarcastic message to my inbox and left an incredibly rude response to my review, saying that I was lying and acting strange, and that I wasn’t welcome back.I decided to request a partial refund because her antagonistic behavior was the nail in the coffin. I was courteous and respectful, and I provided photos. Joanna threw an absolute temper tantrum. She denied my request, said I was lying, and called me a scammer. She told me to “stay somewhere I could afford” next time; she really thinks her moldy shack is the Taj Mahal!She threatened me and tried to intimidate me by saying that “I should be very careful” because “she’s the wrong person to mess with.” She even sent me a screenshot of my full name and address! She was basically threatening to dox me unless I dropped the issue.Of course, she blocked me before I could respond because she’s a coward and a control-freak who needs to have the last word. I called the police to report Joanna’s threats, and she’s now falsely accusing me of telephonic harassment. (I don’t even have her number, we communicated through the app)!Airbnb won’t refund me the amount I asked for because “it’s up to the host and she denied.” They refunded me a measly $200 when I spent about $830+ They’re acting so unhelpful and indifferent about this when I spent all day talking to support, feeling scared for my safety, and physically shaking because I was so upset. She should be removed from the platform, but Airbnb is dragging their heels on that too.",1
"Misleading listing, disastrous support, financial loss – Airbnb failed us.","Me and my partner booked a two-month stay in Bali via Airbnb (July–Sept 2025), in a listing clearly described as an ""Entire Place"". Upon arrival, we found the kitchen was shared with others — something that was never mentioned in the title or shown in the photos.Our first support call was promising. The agent admitted it was misleading and told us we were eligible for a full refund and help to rebook another property covering the necessary price difference. However, the call was cut short, and in the next conversation, Airbnb denied everything.We were offered only a refund we’d already paid, plus a €300 coupon usable *only* on Airbnb that only covered their fees for the new place. We had no choice but to accept the coupon because we didn’t have funds to rebook elsewhere immediately. The result: we could only afford one month of accommodation instead of two — and were left scrambling, again, to find a new place.Worse still: the original misleading listing is *still live*, with the information of shared places in ""security"" tab, even after being reported.This has been the most frustrating and disappointing experience I’ve ever had with a global company.

Airbnb Customer Service From Hell,"This rating serves as a formal complaint and request for corrective action regarding Airbnb’s mishandling of our review submission process, as discussed with multiple representatives, including Jenesis, a senior supervisor.As I have clearly explained, my concern lies in Airbnb’s failure to allow the submission of a valid second review following incorrect information provided by Airbnb staff. Specifically, during a call placed several days ago, an Airbnb representative explicitly stated that no review had been submitted from our account. Based on this information—which I now understand to have been inaccurate—I immediately informed my husband, who submitted a new review in good faith, believing the original had not been recorded.It is highly disturbing that Airbnb representatives now claim this sequence of events is irrelevant. The facts are fully supported by Airbnb’s internal call logs and timestamped review records. The assertion that my account is inaccurate is not only factually incorrect but, as conveyed by Jenesis, is unprofessionally dismissive and borders on defamatory. His refusal to acknowledge this as a technical issue or to engage with the facts objectively is unacceptable and appears to reflect a lack of due process and good faith.As a long-standing and paying Airbnb Superhost, I am entitled to accurate information, transparency, and equitable treatment. The failure to recognize an error that originated with Airbnb, which subsequently resulted in our inability to provide meaningful and timely feedback, is both negligent and harmful. The implication that my input is now invalid due to internal errors—errors I was assured did not exist—raises serious concerns about procedural fairness and potential liability on Airbnb’s part.Furthermore, I was informed by Jenesis that there exists a formal policy prohibiting Airbnb staff from disclosing the feedback evaluation process. If this is accurate, it raises grave concerns about transparency and accountability. Customers must have the right to understand how their feedback is handled—particularly when that feedback could influence significant financial outcomes for hosts.The overall handling of this situation appears, at best, negligent and, at worst, intentionally obstructive. I request an immediate and impartial investigation into this matter. I further expect a written response clarifying (1) whether the review submission timeline corroborates my account, (2) what corrective action will be taken to allow for fair review submission, and (3) what formal policy supports the denial of transparency as described by Jenesis.Please consider this notice a documented escalation. Should this matter not be addressed adequately and in a timely manner, I will be compelled to explore all available legal remedies, including but not limited to filing complaints with consumer protection agencies and pursuing recourse for damages incurred by this procedural failure.",1

"Factual Review Censored, Host Lies Allowed – Safety Ignored","I had a deeply disappointing experience with Airbnb's support and review system following a serious safety issue during a June 2024 stay at Gerberngasse 4, 3600 Thun, Switzerland.My child was trapped in the bathroom due to a faulty lock, and the host refused to pay the emergency locksmith fee (925 CHF), which I had to cover myself. Airbnb later reimbursed me, confirming the issue was real. I also discovered that the apartment key was identical to the building key, creating a major security risk — which I reported with video evidence. Airbnb never responded to that.Worse, Airbnb removed my factual review without explanation, never gave me a chance to revise it, and allowed the host to publish a false review accusing me of blackmail. This shows Airbnb’s review system is biased toward hosts and hides critical safety information from future guests.When it comes to guest protection and honest transparency, Airbnb failed on every level. I no longer trust the platform to handle safety issues or guest reviews fairly.",1
Generally I find the AirBnb system…,"Generally I find the AirBnb system rather bad. With the hotels and other big renters it works ok, but with the private hosts (which, avowedly, are what makes the app stand out), it differs from case to case. Some hosts seem to forget that they run a business, and don't offer informal couch-surfing opportunities, and might behave impolitely or unprofessionally; and if you stumble upon such an unfortunate person - you get very little protection, as the company wants to protect its image first. Plus, the ability of hosts to write the reviews of their guests, while seemingly fair, opens the way to defamatory claims in revenge. All in all it's not a good dynamics and if you want to use it, especially renting from private persons, know it is a risk.",2
"Negative experience , shady ads","Negative experience as the ad mentioned don't worry you won't be charged, once we reserved we got charged and there is no cancelation policy.Then the host refused to send access key to us unless we send our passports and refused to refund.The whole exp is bad",1
Never provide your bank details — they do not protect you.,"I made a simple, honest mistake: booked a property and cancelled within minutes. No harm done. The listing was immediately re-listed, and the host faced zero loss. But Airbnb refused to refund the money — because the host (a large, hotel-scale operator) said no.Airbnb didn’t step in. Didn’t protect me. Didn’t care that I was a real person, not a policy clause. I entrusted them with my bank details thinking there were safeguards. I was wrong.Instead of fairness or empathy, I got automated replies and empty apologies. They sided with the business, not the guest. Now I’m out hundreds of dollars — and they’re fine with that.This platform protects hosts, not guests. If something goes wrong, you’re on your own.I’ll never use Airbnb again. And I strongly urge you: do not trust this platform with your money.",1
Airbnb terrible.,"We rented what we thought was a 1 bedroom in Alicante Spain for 2 weeks.  We got a miniscul room with a burner for kitchen, without a sofa, our fault we trusted Airbnb and did not check properly. The room was smaller than the previous studio we had rented in the same building before.It was horrible. The pictures were totally misleading. We travel a lot but we will never use Airbnb again. They cheated us.",1
Help: €250 voucher invalid after cancellation — any way to recover it?,"I recently booked an Airbnb using a €250 voucher, which I paid for myself (not a promo or gift card). Due to unforeseen circumstances, I had to cancel – within the free cancellation window.Now Airbnb tells me the voucher is completely gone.No refund, no reactivation, no re-use. Just lost.The worst part:I was ready to rebook the exact same listing or apply the voucher to a new one immediately. I even asked to reverse the cancellation. But Airbnb refuses to help.This policy was nowhere clearly communicated during checkout or cancellation. There was no warning that using the voucher would make it vanish upon cancellation – even if I rebook instantly.Their customer support is cold and unhelpful.I’m a student – €250 is a massive amount of money for me. I’ve used Airbnb for years, but this experience feels like a slap in the face.If this isn’t resolved, I’ll delete my account permanently and move to other platforms.Has anyone successfully fought a similar case? Are there legal options (EU/Germany)? I’m seriously considering consumer protection or going public.",1
Booking cancelled by host 3 days before stay date,Booked my London apartment on Airbnb 8 months before our travel date and host cancelled 3 days before our travel date after Airbnb had even charged me the amount.  Gave some flimsy excuse about some maintenance issues.  Airbnb gave a total compensation of $200 for 6 night stay.  Had to find something else in July peak season and had to pay about 3 times the cost for last minute booking and that too for an apartment which was not so good.  Found out hands on the ‘ugly’ side of Airbnb.  Don’t think I will ever use it again.   Sorry Airbnb but I will not ever risk booking with you guys again - if this is how easily hosts can pull out and cancel on you.,1
Unfair claim – no response despite objection,"Bewertung: ★☆☆☆☆ (still too much)In my case, Airbnb lacked any sense of decency. During my stay, my two-year-old son accidentally locked himself in the bedroom. It was an acute emergency – the child was panicking, no help was available, and we had to break down the door to prevent it from getting worse.What does Airbnb do? Instead of showing understanding, they silently slapped me with a €475 damage claim – even though:• my child is not legally liable,• this was an absolutely exceptional situation,• AirCover, according to its own guidelines, should be there for exactly such cases,• I never saw an official invoice from the host.I spent hours submitting evidence, lodged multiple objections by phone and in writing, but was fobbed off with standard platitudes. My conversations were simply closed, my repeated attempts to cancel the payment were ignored – and today, despite open clarification, a debit was initiated. Without my consent.I'm currently in the postpartum period following a C-section, caring for a newborn and three other children—and Airbnb is causing me completely unnecessary stress in this situation.This platform is failing families, ignoring its own policies, and treating customers like numbers. I will now refer the case to the European Consumer Centre (EVZ), initiate legal action, and make this public so others know how Airbnb handles emergencies.AirCover? A farce. Trust? Destroyed. Never again with Airbnb.",1
The most disgraceful customer service…,"The most disgraceful customer service on the planet. Airbnb may have a good looking website, but scratch beneath the surface and you will discover a company which outsources its entire customer service to telemarkers in the Phillipines who read from scripts and NEVER side with the customer. This is a corrupt, money grabbing business which charges high fees and gives you nothing back. Its outrageous that a US based firm has non existent customer service and send customers to remote call centres in the Phillipines.",1

Avoid Airbnb like the plague.,As with others I would give zero points if it were possible.Have been a frequent Airbnb customer for over 9 years but all that stops after one horrific experience where a listing was misrepresentative and trying to get a resolution out of Airbnb customer services has been the biggest waste of time ever.Badly typed messages which make no sense. Threads closed down when they can’t answer simple questions. Telephone calls promised and never made. The host is allowed to write malicious lies in their review without recourse.That’s me done I’m never using Airbnb again and would advise anyone checking them out here to avoid them too. Use VRBO or other options first.,1
Very Disappointed with Airbnb’s Support – Guests Deserve Better,"Generally I had good experiences with airbnb, but my recent stay and Airbnb’s response to it were deeply disappointing.The apartment I booked was completely misrepresented. It was outdated, dirty, and in poor condition. The shower had visible mold, light fixtures were literally taped to the walls, and the place didn’t match the photos at all. It was also missing a washer, even though the listing claimed there was one.To make matters worse, the host failed to send us check-in information, even though we clearly communicated our arrival time. We were left waiting outside for over an hour and had to call to finally get access. Throughout the stay, the host was unresponsive and claimed to have missed our messages. The apartment was also extremely noisy due to being right next to a train line and a busy road something the listing failed to mention.I reported all of this to Airbnb, expecting a fair resolution. Despite these serious issues, they only offered a small refund. That response felt completely inadequate given the situation. It made me feel like Airbnb doesn't take guest concerns seriously or uphold the standards they claim to enforce.Airbnb needs to do much better in holding hosts accountable and supporting guests when things go wrong. As a loyal customer, I expected more, and I’m now reconsidering whether to book with them again in the future.",1
"Don’t trust Airbnb, they only care about money not hosts","I am a long-time Airbnb host who experienced a serious incident of property damage caused by a verified guest who checked out on a Sunday at 12:00 PM. Upon entering the property shortly after, I found substantial damage: furniture broken, household items destroyed, and the unit left in a severely unclean state. The condition of the home was distressing to the point I was unable to speak for several minutes due to the shock and stress.Given that I had another guest arriving at 4:00 PM the same day, I was forced to act immediately. I hired a contractor for urgent repairs and paid for additional cleaning personnel to restore the property to a presentable and safe condition.I submitted a claim through Airbnb’s Resolution Center for $1,125, supported by legitimate invoices for repair and cleaning. Despite full documentation, the Airbnb case manager unilaterally reduced my reimbursement to $440, without providing adequate justification. In particular, my dining table, originally purchased for $1,500 including six chairs, was assessed at a mere $212.Airbnb initially assured me that damages would be covered under their Host Guarantee. However, the actual outcome reflects a serious lack of support and responsibility on their part. The process was unreasonably delayed, communication was minimal, and the final decision grossly undervalued the verified losses I incurred.This situation has caused undue stress, financial loss, and an erosion of trust in Airbnb as a platform that claims to protect its hosts. I am formally requesting a review of this case, and I am prepared to escalate the matter through consumer protection avenues if necessary.Airbnb must be held accountable for honoring the policies they advertise to hosts — anything less is misleading and unacceptable.",1
"Ignoring healthy risks, no accountability","Title: Very Poor Guest Support Despite Clear Evidence – Case A59944749I’ve used Airbnb many times, but this was the worst experience I’ve had and Airbnb’s guest support completely failed me.I stayed at a property with a cockroach infestation, sewage flooding and no running water for part of the stay. Despite clear evidence, including photos, video, and a plumber being sent, I was only offered a partial refund of £98, which doesn’t even cover the night I had to flee the property.The plumbing returned mysteriously just as the plumber arrived suggesting it was turned off externally. This was never investigated.Airbnb support was slow, fragmented, and closed the case while the issues were ongoing. I was told their “AirCover” policy could only offer 30% back for “inconveniences” despite the stay being unsafe.I had to stay elsewhere for 2 nights the sewage issue was so bad, the support team were vague and didnt provide help. Expecting me to suck it up and stay in a property where I couldn't use the bathroom at all because it wss covered in sewage.I’ve submitted formal feedback and asked repeatedly for escalation. This was a six-week booking, not a weekend stay. The system seems to favour the host no matter the severity of the guest’s experience.Case ID: A59944749This outcome shows a deep flaw in Airbnb’s protections. I no longer feel confident booking through Airbnb, especially for longer stays.--UPDATE-- They closed the case without resolution and an on-going cockroach issue.",1

The property was filthy, damaged, and completely misrepresented, with outdated photos that clearly no longer reflect its actual condition. We left within minutes of arriving — it was that bad.We clearly explained everything and requested a refund. The host ignored us, and Airbnb brushed it off, hiding behind policy and refusing to take any real accountability. No inspection, no follow-up, no support. Just an easy win for the host, and a complete loss for us — even with travel insurance in place.Airbnb now seems more interested in protecting dishonest hosts than standing by its guests. If someone cancels in good faith for valid reasons, and Airbnb offers zero protection or action, then why should anyone feel safe booking through the platform?Truly disgraceful customer service. I will never trust Airbnb again, and I strongly urge others to think twice before handing over your money to a system that clearly doesn’t protect you.",1
Liars and inept customer care,"Company fails to follow their own policy.I stayed at a property where there was rampant black mould and dripping from the ceiling left giant puddles on the kitchen tiles, making it slippery and dangerous. The listing and host did not indicate any of those issues. I photographed the issues, and contacted Airbnb to make them aware and seek compensation.After many hours of making my points, on chat and calls, I kept getting useless blanket responses as a way of evading their responsibility of care.Do not trust this company, and if you have alternative to find accommodation, I recommend you take it.",1

Airbnb allows RAPISTS to host,The host entered the apartment while I was outside and my girlfriend was having a shower. I contacted Airbnb support and said it was urgent and was reporting a crime and wanted to leave. They made me wait like they could not care less. Or maybe it is too common and airbnb rather get paid while allowing rapes to go on. Do not rent apartments on airbnb unless you want to risk being raped because they do not care. They make you wait hours because THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT GUESTS BEING SEEN NAKED OR RAPED! THEY do their best to ignore your safety too because they do not want to refund you when you are at risk. This is a criminal company and should be shut down! Everyone working for Airbnb should be put in jail!,1
Came For A Vacation.. Almost Walked Into A Nightmare,"I’ve never written a review like this, but what happened to my family and me deserves serious attention—not just as a customer complaint, but as a safety warning.We arrived late at night to our Airbnb rental after a long day of travel, exhausted and just hoping to get our kids into bed.Trusting Airbnb’s built-in navigation feature—something we assumed would be accurate and reliable—we followed the provided directions. What happened next was completely unacceptable: the navigation led us to the next door neighbors home. In the dark, with unfamiliar surroundings, and in a residential neighborhood, we unknowingly approached and tried to access a private home that was not our rental. The neighbors, THANKFULLY, opened their door and graciously told the two frazzled women and their three children in tow trying to break into their home, that the AirBnB that we were looking for was next door.I cannot emphasize enough how dangerous this situation could have become. Imagine being a homeowner and seeing strangers—my family and I—approaching your door at 10pm, shaking your door, pissed off that the door code isn't working. It’s a terrifying scenario for both parties. We were lucky. The residents were understandably alarmed but not confrontational. Had the homeowners been more frightened or defensive, or had this occurred in a place with heightened security concerns, the outcome could have been catastrophic. People have been shot in driveways for less. We reached out to the host, and he was responsive, but didn't seem to recognize the gravity of the situation.We were shaken, and deeply unsettled. This was not user error. This was a failure of Airbnb’s system—a failure with potentially grave consequences.I want to be clear: this isn’t just an inconvenience or a tech glitch. It’s a serious safety flaw. Airbnb cannot afford to have its internal navigation directing guests to the wrong addresses, especially not at night and especially not when tensions can escalate quickly in unfamiliar neighborhoods. If Airbnb is going to offer built-in navigation tools, they must be rigorously verified and guaranteed accurate. Otherwise, don’t offer them at all. Until this issue is addressed, I strongly urge future guests to double-check addresses manually using trusted map services—and I urge Airbnb to treat this as the liability risk and public safety hazard it clearly is.We came for a vacation. We nearly walked into a nightmare.",1
Absolutely no customer support,"Absolutely no customer support. I had a terrible experience with a host, and Airbnb’s response was to ask me to work it out directly with them—burning through the only 72-hour window they offer for support. After 72 hours of being mistreated by the host, Airbnb said they could no longer help because the time had expired. Completely unacceptable. This was my first and last time using Airbnb. Never again.",1
Their website is problematic,"Their website is problematic.   For months I could not log in.   Today I was able to, but the prices they showed were in some foreign currency that I did not recognize.   I tried again, and this time the site sent me to services that I am not interested in.  Come on!  Don't you want us to be your customer?",2
Their reviews system can't be trusted,"I stayed in a dirty, unmaintained, and old apartment. I added a review so other people would be aware. After one month, I received a notification from Airbnb stating that my review had been removed because it involved ""pressure or coercion."", which is not true. They are just trying to hide the truth.For reference, here is my review:The flat is well-located, but we didn’t enjoy our stay for several reasons:•⁠  ⁠Mattresses were very thin and uncomfortable.•⁠  ⁠Heating never worked. We reported it on Friday; after a 30 min call, the technician couldn’t fix it. The host then disappeared until Monday and suddenly demanded access within 50 minutes while we were out (after ignoring the problem all weekend).•⁠  ⁠The shower kept cutting out, alternating scalding and freezing water.•⁠  ⁠No soap in the bathroom.•⁠  ⁠Living-room seats were cramped and looked like cut-up, uncovered foam.•⁠  ⁠Towels were worn and cheap.•⁠  ⁠No drying rack for clothes.•⁠  ⁠Flat smelled musty and lacked ventilation.•⁠  ⁠Overall, old and cheap furniture•⁠  ⁠Cleanliness was poor. Eg. heavy dust, dirt, and an old pair of slippers under the beds.",1
Security Deposit Return,"After we departed and the host sent two complimentary messages about the condition of the apartment (""We will write you a great five star review with great comments!

Trashy Company Account Permanently Shut,"Extremly Horrible pls READ: Airbnb shut down my account for having my gun with me where there are a lot of bears, there was one in the back yard so I took the gun from the car inside for caution, forgot the gun there and the airbnb shut down my account, I’ll be happily using platforms that are humanity compliant and not this trash of a company, even if my account gets returned I’ll boycott Airbnb moving forward.My appeal got denied despite deliberate danger of having bears all over these mountains, Airbnb is distasteful.",1
Misleading claim of “All fees included”,"The upfront claim that prices shown would include all fees was wrong. (I understand that taxes would be additional). A displayed price for 4 nights in Atlanta was NOT inclusive of fees, and when I attempted to reserve the property an Airbnb fee appeared. The result was that an estimated $1400 total with taxes became $1600 I did not book.A series of chats provided no relief. I felt that a waiver of the Airbnb fee was warranted but, apparently, there is no mechanism at Airbnb to allow this. I notice that since my chats, the property’s displayed pricing has been corrected.Poor response to my inquiry. I should note that this mis-step is Airbnb’s fault, not the host’s.",1
Airbnb / Host communication = complete joke.,"I booked an apartment on March 16th for September 5th–11th in Dubrovnik. Unfortunately, due to circumstances in my family, I couldn’t go. I asked for a full refund two months before my stay, which I think is more than enough time for the host to find new guests. I paid €640 in March, but all I got back was €278 — I lost almost €400 for something the host had nothing to do with, but also did nothing to help with.I tried to contact the host many times and explained my situation — no answer. I even tried to call him, but the phone number he gave to Airbnb wasn’t real. He says guests can email him, but there’s no email address to write to — complete joke. Even Airbnb support tried to reach him and he didn’t respond. This shows how unprofessional this host (and honestly the platform) can be. Bookingdotcom has better options and policies for fair refunds — I don’t understand how something like this is allowed here. I do not recommend booking with this host/platform.",1

The host is Henry and Carol, in front of the Harrords store in London.Cozy pod is the name of the ad and today I looked and it was advertised there again. I want to be reimbursed for the amount that I had to pay much more expensive in another place and the shock I felt I will never forget. How much I I was shaking. I didn't even have the right to cry, because I needed to find a place. Everyone knows how expensive and difficult London is to find. I did it through booking because I lost confidence in Airbnb.",1

Airbnb Allowed Dangerous Guest and Refuses to Remove His Review,"As an Airbnb host, I was put in a terrifying situation. A guest named Ali booked my property for 3–5 June 2025. Just before his arrival, I discovered he had a criminal record including a murder conviction. I reported this immediately to Airbnb.After hours of delay, Airbnb confirmed the threat and cancelled his booking, arranging alternative accommodation. However, despite their own safety decision, they are now refusing to remove his review — a review from someone they deemed too dangerous to stay in my home.I feel unsupported, unsafe, and punished for doing the right thing.

The outside kitchen which appeared beautiful in the pictures was not functioning. There was trash thrown on the side of the house. The host Valerie was very rude. She ask us to vacate to property. We were all seniors with no place to move. Then the ABNB support agreed with the Host after we submitted pictures to them. I’m done with AirBnb never again.

Trustpilot отзыв:AIRBNB ignored evidence and braked my reputation,"Trustpilot отзыв:I have been a loyal Airbnb Superhost for many years with over 130 five-star reviews and a proven record of guest satisfaction.Recently, I faced a deeply unfair situation that completely shattered my trust in Airbnb’s system. A guest entered my apartment on the wrong date due to her own mistake, which is fully documented in Airbnb’s messaging system. Despite her clear responsibility, she blamed me in her public review.What is worse, the guest contacted me via private WhatsApp messages and sent her PayPal payment request while simultaneously making additional complaints. This was a clear case of financial pressure and coercion outside the Airbnb platform. I provided all the evidence, including screenshots, proving this guest’s unethical behavior.However, Airbnb rejected my appeal automatically, within seconds, without allowing me to defend myself properly or speak to anyone from the decision-making team. It was obvious that no real human reviewed my case.I tried multiple times to escalate the situation, to talk to Senior Management, but I was blocked at every step. I was told that “the decision cannot be reversed” even though I had undeniable proof.After years of working hard to maintain my Superhost status and offer the best possible guest experience, Airbnb simply destroyed my reputation by ignoring the facts.Airbnb no longer protects its Superhosts. The platform now prioritizes unjust guest reviews, even when they are provably false and financially coercive.This is a shocking and devastating experience that I never expected from Airbnb.",1
Refund Pending,"I’m extremely frustrated with Airbnb. My friends and I booked a stay in Polperro for July 19–20 with a host named LUCA. The payment was processed, but then the host declined our request because she doesn’t accept ONE-NIGHT reservations—something that should’ve been clearly stated in the listing upfront. Now our money is on hold, and we’re unable to book another place. Most listings are filling up quickly, and we’re stuck. The whole process feels really unfair—if a host needs to approve a stay, that should happen before any payment is taken. Airbnb’s only response has been to tell us to WAIT, which is incredibly frustrating.",2
Newly refurbished - no chance!,"Newly refurbished? Yes 10 years ago maybe! We are appalled at how we were treated both through air BnB and the hosts. The property didn’t not match the pictures on the booking. We raised the issues on day 1 of the trip and the host tried to send somone out to sort it, however they could not sort the problems. Stained headboard, broken bed which a panel fell on my mums leg. We went away as a family for my brothers wedding with babies and our dog which the listing clearly stated pets were allowed (at no extra charge or authorisation needed). Air BnB have been no help as they stated we should have made air BnB aware on day one so they could move us. We could not be moved or have the time do this as mentioned we had babies and were there for my brothers wedding so we couldn’t just leave the wedding to be moved houses - it’s completely impractical. I have picture evidence of everything including WhatsApp messages proving we notified the host of all the issues immediately. The house was not maintained and was quite frankly filthy to the point we had to clean it and sleep on top of sleeping bags on the bed. I have left a bad review on the hosts which has now resulted in them leaving a bed review about us - which is laughable. The whole process is floored and we were only refunded £125 cleaning fee, out of the £1,200 we wait. It’s honestly a joke. I use Airbnb all the time and the one time we have had a problem it’s not gone against us. It’s caused nothing but stress and upset and ruined what was supposed to be a lovely weekend celebrating a wedding. I would love to upload the pictures for other guests to be aware of but surprisingly you can’t!!!!Avoid Anna & John hosts who supposedly are from London - now living in wales. Also a lie they told us they now live in Australia. Just money for them no care in their actual properties.The house was stayed at sleeps up to 13 people in Treforest Wales.As a proclaimed family not sure how they sleep at night tbh!",1
Horrible Cancellation Policy,"I booked a place and eight days later, two weeks before I was booked to stay, I had to cancel for an illness in the family. Airbnb did nothing to assist. They leave it up to the host and support the hosts decision as to whether or not you will get a refund. The worst part is the host can book someone else for the same days that I already paid for. So even if someone else books the same days, the host and Airbnb keep the money from both transactions. I am closing my account.",1
The worst company by far!,"The worst company by far! It feels like it's run by clueless teenagers who are just reading off a script. I sent evidence that the room I booked in a shared flat was entered into without my knowledge and consent by three different people on top of a range of other issues, which was acknowledged by the call handler who told me it's wrong. Then they spent 3 days ''investigating'' asking me to repeat everything all over again to 3 different people, mad a decision taking the host's side and couldn't even bother to explain why. I'm just given their decision and the case is closed. They communicate through links. The link to their T&C states unauthorised entry into the rented premises is prohibited. Yet, they rule out in favour of the host with no explanation whatsoever. I won't even begin to describe the other issues which made me leave the place earlier losing money which they won't recover from the host. Their protection is non-existent. There's no cover, no insurance. You're on your own. It's all just a smoke screen. This is not the first issue I've had with Air Bnb over the years. But it is definitely the last as I'll never use Air Bnb again. Horrific!",1

Air BNB is Terrible!!!!!,"I have been using air bnb for years….over 27 stays and have never had a problem until now. I rented a place and had nothing but problems from the start. I wish we could put in pictures to show the justice. I walked into the home and immediately the first thing I saw was overgrown grass up to my 6 foot tall husband’s waist into the stomach with abandoned shopping carts everywhere. They said we would have use of a patio that was a lie. The entire property wreaked like animal urine, and you could see spots on the carpet and on the couch, where there was obvious animal urine. Outside of that there was food left in the sink. There was food left in the microwave. The entire floor was gross. I believe this just touches the surface of everything that I encountered and that my children were forced to sleep in the animal Urine smell because I was told by the host to just use for breeze we didn’t get in until 11:30 PM so we had no choice but to sleep there. Another thing we were not told is you could hear every movement going through the house so nobody got any sleep. I contacted Airbnb immediately at 5 AM the next morning. I went on for days with Airbnb, trying to get a refund I was told at one point I would receive a refund I didn’t. I was told to leave the property immediately that morning, and I would get a refund which I left the property and still again no refund at the very beginning of our trip I had to come out another $700 just to find last-minute housing for me and my family finally after days of arguing with Airbnb they only refunded me half of what I paid for the week of the Airbnb, which they didn’t even want to do that. The only reason they did was because what they claimed was an employee that was not qualified to told me that I would get a refund. I went to the highest person at Airbnb. I am very, very disgusted and overall dissatisfied and will not be using Airbnb again. I will be using VRBO and Expedia rentals. My renter was nothing that was described in the pictures. The smell was unbearable and a health hazard to my children and Airbnb refused to do nothing about it but give me half of a refund only because somebody messed up and told me they would otherwise I was told by air B and B I would not have gotten a refund. Very disappointed and unsatisfied to say the least beware of any Airbnb‘s that you get because Airbnb will not cover you.",1
RIP off,"Literally they are taking the mickeyThey started with a reasonable commission and now they’re your 50% business partner.It’s your house, you wash the bedding, you clean the house, you do the communication, you host the guests and Airbnb takes the half if your earning.Look somewhere else I’d say. Plenty options",1
Poor Customer Support and Overpriced,"I’ve used Airbnb multiple times over the years, but my recent experience has completely put me off. When things go wrong, Airbnb does not have your back. I had an issue with a listing that was completely misrepresented – dirty, unsafe, and nothing like the photos – and Airbnb’s support team was slow, unhelpful, and clearly more interested in protecting the host than solving the problem.Trying to get a refund or even proper communication was like pulling teeth. They talk a big game about “trust and safety,” but when you’re actually in a bad situation, you’re left to fend for yourself.What’s worse, Airbnb has become ridiculously overpriced. Cleaning fees, service fees, and vague cancellation policies make the final cost far higher than expected. I’ve since tried other platforms that are not only cheaper but actually care about their customers when issues arise.I won’t be using Airbnb again – there are better, more transparent alternatives out there.",1
Terrible customer service,"I've been a loyal Airbnb user for nearly a decade, but recent experiences have left me deeply disappointed.First, I accidentally made a booking and attempted to cancel it within seconds. Despite the immediate action, I lost nearly £3,000 due to Airbnb’s rigid cancellation process. The user interface is confusing and lacks clear warnings for high-value transactions—something that should be a basic standard for any platform handling large sums. Airbnb offered no meaningful support or resolution.Second, I paid for a trip in pounds but was refunded in Airbnb booking credits—without any clear explanation or consent. I wasn’t even aware of what booking credits were at the time. Once again, Airbnb refused to assist or offer a fair resolution.These experiences reflect the worst customer service I’ve encountered in over 10 years of using online platforms. Airbnb’s lack of transparency, inflexible policies, and unhelpful support have eroded my trust in a brand I once valued.",1

"Unsafe Stay, Misleading Listing – Airbnb Removed My Review","My friend booked the ""Seaside Luxury House on the Suffolk Coast"", hosted by Tim and Lucy, through Airbnb — and it turned into a nightmare.My friend’s car was vandalised overnight while parked on the street outside the property. This made us feel unsafe in the area.Worse, all the windows in the house were screwed shut. We stayed during 30°C heat, and without any way to ventilate the house, it became extremely hot and humid. This made the stay deeply uncomfortable and unsuitable for sleeping or relaxing.I left a 1-star review on Airbnb describing the experience truthfully. Airbnb removed my review and the listing still shows 5 stars, which is completely misleading and dishonest. It feels like Airbnb protects hosts, even when guest safety and comfort are clearly at risk.Airbnb should be ashamed of how this was handled. Guests deserve honesty and safety — not censorship.",1
Shady Airbnb  After being a super host for 8 years o…,After being a super host for 8 years o no longer will be a part of such a shady company,1
One of the Worst Airbnb Experiences Ever – Safety Nightmare and Total Scam,"The property we stayed at is an absolute disgrace and a ticking time bomb of safety hazards. Most alarming was the padlock on the back deck gate, which meant there was only one exit through the front door. In an emergency like a fire, we could have been trapped and killed inside. When I raised this very real and obvious safety issue with the host, my concern was flat-out ignored. This is likely a blatant violation of the fire code and the short-term rental ordinance of Pagosa Springs.To make matters worse, there were multiple surveillance cameras installed around the property—some shockingly aimed directly into private living spaces like bedrooms and the living room. This is a massive invasion of privacy and absolutely unacceptable.One upstairs bedroom had a rough, unfinished wood floor with exposed nails—combined with the house’s “shoes off” policy, this was a recipe for injuries. One of our guests found out the hard way with cuts and splinters.The kitchen was another horror show. The “non-stick” cookware had lost all its coating, meaning anyone cooking with it was being poisoned with PFAS chemicals—known carcinogens linked to cancer. The grill was filthy and caked with grease, completely unusable and a major fire hazard. Thank goodness we checked it before trying to light it.There was also a cracked ceramic tile in the kitchen with razor-sharp edges, creating yet another spot where you had to wear shoes indoors for basic safety.The so-called “game room” was a pathetic joke—after cramming in the ping pong and shuffleboard tables, there were only inches left for a person to squeeze in, rendering these amenities completely useless.In the primary bedroom, there were no bedside lamps, forcing us to stumble around in the dark to find wall switches every night.When we arrived, the home was stifling and smelled off, with an indoor temperature of 90 degrees. It took hours to cool it down to 75, and with no cooling upstairs, those rooms were basically uninhabitable during the day and well into the night.The host, VIP Vacation Services in Pagosa Springs, was the worst part. They ignored safety concerns, insisted on communicating outside of Airbnb, and demanded additional payments outside the platform—both clear violations of Airbnb’s policies.Airbnb support has been a complete joke in trying to resolve these issues, offering no meaningful solution so far. This property should not be listed on Airbnb or anywhere else until these major safety, health, and habitability issues are fixed. Rent at your own risk—you’ve been warned.",1
Unsafe conditions,"Unsafe conditions, mold, and poor support — AirCover failed meI stayed at an Airbnb where water was leaking from the ceiling onto the bed and visible black mold was growing in the HVAC vent above me. I reported the issue immediately after arrival, but had no safe option to leave right away — it was late at night, the neighborhood was unsafe, and I had no alternative accommodation.Despite reporting this under AirCover, I received only a partial refund, even though the place was clearly unfit for living. I had to sleep one night under these conditions only because I had no other choice. I was deeply concerned for my health, and my dog developed breathing problems after this stay.Support was slow, and in the end, they said a full refund was “not possible,” even though I followed all the steps required by Airbnb’s policies. This was a clear failure of the AirCover guarantee, and it left me feeling dismissed and unsupported.If Airbnb really values guest safety, they should have handled this very differently. I do not feel protected, and I now question whether I can trust the platform at all.",1
Left without accommodation before flight — no support,"My Airbnb reservation was canceled by the host after the stay had already started. I was traveling with children and expected Airbnb to handle the situation responsibly.Unfortunately, Airbnb failed to provide a confirmed replacement or follow their own guest protection policy. I received only a $300 coupon and no guaranteed alternative. I still have no place to stay, and my flight is tomorrow.This was my first Airbnb booking, and it turned into a deeply stressful and disappointing experience. I hope Airbnb improves how it handles urgent cancellations like this one.",1

Stayed in what was supposed to be 5 star,"Stayed in what was supposed to be a super host 5 star accommodation described by Air B and B in Hollow cottage Doolin co Clare. The house was dirty and not near the village as described. When I went back to Air B and B looking for compensation although the people I spoke to were polite the whole system is ridiculous, I don't know how many times I had to ring and I resend the pictures. I would urge anyone to read the small print re refunds before you book with them, and really I would suggest not using them at all. Although I received a minimum refund from the host it did not reflect the awful stay we had. I was told I should have left the place and try and find new accommodation when I was in Doolin to attend my nieces wedding and there was no other accommodation available. Clearly as a business they don't really care about peoples reviews and experiences. I do feel sorry for the genuine super hosts that put so much effort into making their accommodation good when there are other like we had that Air B and B claim is 5 star when I wouldn't rate is as even one star. I would love to be able to show the pictures I took so everyone could see what I mean but they don't even give you that chance. All in all I will never use them again to book accommodation.",1
Falsely Accused by Airbnb Host – 3 Years Without Justice or Support,"I’m writing this after nearly three years of trying to resolve a completely false and damaging accusation made by an Airbnb host, and once again, Airbnb’s customer support has shut down the conversation without providing any real help.During a group trip, the host accused me and my guests of watching adult content on their television — a completely false and unfounded claim. Even more disturbing is how the host manipulated the platform by writing “P orn” (with a space) in the review to bypass Airbnb’s moderation system. Despite this clear manipulation and the fact that the accusation is baseless, the review remains on the platform.To make matters worse, I was removed from the trip after the stay, which prevented me from leaving my own review or responding publicly to defend myself. I lost my right to reply, while the host was allowed to publicly attack my character.I contacted Airbnb support multiple times over the past three years. Each time, I carefully explained the situation and submitted evidence. The response has always been the same: “We consider the case closed.” No real review, no fair process, no support for the guest — just a dead-end.The host’s accusation is not just petty — it is harmful, embarrassing, and untrue. It has affected my reputation on the platform and caused me enormous frustration. It’s shocking that Airbnb allows hosts to make defamatory claims without proof, and then silences the guest who is trying to respond.I’ve always used Airbnb with respect and followed the rules. I never expected to be treated this way — not just by a dishonest host, but by a platform that claims to “build trust” and “support the community.”After years of being ignored, I’m sharing my story here in hopes that someone will listen. Airbnb must be held accountable when it fails to protect its users from false accusations and one-sided reviews. A platform that promotes “community” should ensure fairness — not silence the victims.",1

It’s a total hassle.Will never use Airbnb again, never had a problem like that with booking.com or any other site.",1
"Betsy the retro caravan in Dundee, bad hosts on airbnb","Booked ""Betsy the retro caravan in the woods"" in Angus, Scotland with the host Sally Marie in March this year for the 5th of July. The host knew it was for 2 festival goers and that the festival closes at 11pm. They asked tonight, the day before the booking what time we'd arrive only to state they didn't want my custom as there would be 2 cars as one guest is from Aberdeen and she was going to meet us there & I am from Glasgow. They stated they didn't want us coming back in the early hours as we'd ""rouse"" the guard dogs and other guests. There was only 2 people staying there as per the rules which wouldn't have been broken by us. They knew we'd be getting back late anyway as we are attending a festival. I've had to cancel the booking the night before we were due to stay because this host didn't state there was a curfew.No where on their listing do they state the type of guests they wanted nor did they say parking was limited.Is discrimination over the type of guests we are and their hosts communication is terrible. I did try and speak with them in march only to be told speak nearer the time.So now I'm left with one day to find alternative accommodation for 2 people.They have stated we are not the sort of guests they want as we'd annoy other guests and the animals because we'd be getting back in the early morning, probably around 6am due to attending an club night then visiting a friend, it's discrimination not wanting two 40 year old women because we will attend a festival then a night club.If they wanted tea drinking oaps and the sort of customers that prefer watching antiques roadshow over visiting clubs they should state it on their listing.Not happy with Airbnb and this useless host at all",1

AIRBNB DOESNT HELP WITH BAD HOSTS,"I have spent OVER 3 hours trying to report a host after a horrible experience. I wanted to check in and the host said I have to wait an extra hour after regular check in time because they need to still clean it. Got a room reserved for 2 nights (May 13-15, 2025) and when I walked in, I immediately left and asked for a refund. Felt extremely unsafe, wasnt cleaned in what looked like a year, and the host was rude and unprofessional telling me to clean the room and bathroom myself if I want to check in at 5pm (the regular check in time). Host fined me $800 USD for damages (I didnt do) and left an extremely negative and completely false review. After speaking with 6 people because Airbnb made this a 2 month thing.....they still didn't do anything. Because of my truthful review, the host fined a report of discrimination, THIS IS A JOKE!!!! Its insane because there was none and i was polite the entire time to her. When I reached out to Airbnb to see the status of this on July 2, yes no help since May 13......instead of approving my request of deleting the hosts false review of me, Airbnb deleted MY TRUTHFUL review. And when checking on the hosts account, the other negative review that was there (similar to mine) was ALSO DELETED so this host now has 5 stars because out honest reviews were taken off......Airbnb is NOT on your team. This is a very short review because the full story is VERY lengthy. The fact that the worst experience & host on Airbnb HIDES honest reviews, this doesn't make me safe trusting other hosts because it could be the same situation as this one. Airbnb and this host has emotionally distressed me and at this point, with their ""resolution"" have lost me as a client forever and have gained a free bad review anytime I can share the cult Airbnb is. I want to leave a review about Airbnb on Airbnb but it doesn't seem to be an option. At this point I will use other apps or just get the damn hotel. Protect yourselves.EDIT: they said they will not remove the host's false, defamatory and triggering (because of the hosts abuse to me) review. This is my final thoughts on airbnb:Airbnb doesn't care about their guests. Airbnb is putting innocent people in danger by removing the negative (yet truthful) reviews of this host. I do not feel safe with any hosts since Airbnb is trying to keep their ""good"" fake image up.Airbnb support is a joke and I feel betrayed.",1

Dishonest and Useless Airbnb Support – Beware,"Extremely disappointed with Airbnb support. We booked a property described as private, but it turned out to be a shared flat — something never clearly mentioned in the listing. It was noisy and impossible to rest.We contacted Airbnb support immediately after check-in, but they did nothing to help. Instead, they kept telling us they were “waiting for the host to respond.” This was a lie — when we spoke to the property manager (acting as the host), he told us Airbnb had never contacted him at all.Out of a 5-day trip, we wasted more than 28 hours waiting for Airbnb to solve the issue. In the end, it was the property manager who listened to us and negotiated directly with the property owner so we could leave early and get a refund.Airbnb support was useless and misleading. For a company of this size, this level of inaction and dishonesty is unacceptable.",1

Whilst I understand there can be bad hostess who lie and give misleading reviews .  It is up to Airbnb to rectify and act as a third party to protect both parties. Instead their policies enable continued success for repeat situational mishaps and repeat bad dishonest behaviours from hosts.

Wish I could give 0 stars,"Wish I could give 0 stars. Booked a stay after weeks of my group deliberating on which option to pick. Upon confirming the stay I got an notification to verify my account - this was strange as I had verified in 2024 but I still followed the prompts.Throughout the day I kept receiving notifications I would lose my reservation if I did not verify but when I clicked on the link it said I was already verified. Finally I called.At this point I had put in my license photos, confirmed my name, put in the last four of my social, and confirmed my mailing address. The rep told me it was an Airbnb issue and would escalate it. This was after almost an hour on the phone and so I asked if it would be done by 55 mins later when my message said my reservation would cancel. She said mmmhmm to which I asked please for a yes or no - got an mmhmm again so I asked two more times and finally she said “for full transparency no they may take 24 hours.”I asked to be handed to a supervisor and when I finally got one they gaslit me, told me I hadn’t verified even as I told them they could reference the recording from the previous rep and that I could email them screenshots. They wasted my time for another hour before figuring out I WAS verified and it was their fault - during which time I lost the reservation and it was booked when I reached out to try to reserve again once they cleared the issue.I will not go back and would rather pay more for a hotel or try VRBO then ever interact with them again.",1

You're not safe using airbnb,"You're not safe using airbnb.

I was able to capture vidoes, pictures and voice recordings, despite all of that, airbnb fully aware they're allowing a criminal host on their site refused to take down the listing and continues to accept bookings from him.I was hoping they would do the right thing before I take this to every news outlet and involve the government and make sure they suffer losses in millions of dollars. I opened a case with them with bbb, and they somehow changed it to a refund or exchange case. I am not asking for a refund, I'm asking for this case to be investigated, and the host is rightfully removed before he does this to someone else. I'm giving it this week. If nothing is done, there's no point of return on my legal actions.Mind you, I sent them pictures, videos, voice recordings and they still allowed the criminal of a host to continue renting out apartments.I'll make sure I put an end to this.

Stay away from Airbnb.,"I have never had so many issues with trying to get a refund in my life. Airbnb and their customer support team need a serious evaluation.

Me and the host have both reached out to customer service and are still being hassled. I have only received a partial credit of $79 for our $1100 stay that we did not get to even stay one day at. I am very disappointed with Airbnb. I will NEVER use this booking company again in the future. Customer service is horrible, I have had to argue with multiple representatives and when I ask to speak to a manager they say “she will say the same thing” then never connect me. I’ve even been hung up on TWICE just for simply trying to get my money back that the host agreed to refund me.",1

They took our money for 5 nights and we only stayed for one and had to leave for medical conditions within the 254 hr time frame. We literally were scammed out of our moeny.

Flawed ID verification process,"I was a first time UK user, wanting to book a cottage in the Peak District for a few days. The booking was part confirmed, and I'd made an initial deposit payment when i was told I had to have my identity verified.For some reason, AirBNB's system could not do this simply by matching my debit card details with my address (despite me living at the same address for over ten years). Instead they wanted a form of photo ID. They specified either a driving licence; passport or national identity card.Well, I still have the old fashioned paper driving licence and the UK does not have a national identity card. My passport has my photo on it but is expired. however, I proceeded to submitted it anyway, confident that would be acceptable. After all:a) it was acceptable to the Electoral Commission (allowing me to vote UK elections); andb) it was acceptable to my last employer (when they offered me s job).No, it was rejected by AirBNB due tit o being expired.When I rang up to query what alternative there were, i was told, there wasn't any. I pointed out, both on the phone and in an email to customer services, that:a) it is not compulsory to learn to drive;b) it is not compulsory to travel abroad; andc) the UK doesn't have a NIC!The response of AirBNB was simply to reiterate the three options, claiming that its users found reassurance in the ID verification system being in place and as a company, it was seen as a way to combat fraud. I pointed out that if they were so concerned with preventing fraud, then why hadn't they asked me to verify my ID BEFORE TAKING A PAYMENT FROM ME.AirBNB are clearly only interest it taking your money, (not fraud etc). This point was underlined when they emailed me, suggesting that someone else from my group, take up the booking instead.WHAT A BLOODY CHEEK!I raised several issues with the company, including the fact that UK users only have a choice of two forms of ID (not three), but they have repeatedly ignored my queries. indeed, they haven't even acknowledge the points, let alone offer a solution.THIS WAS FIRST EXPERENCE OF TRYING TO USE 'AIRBNB' AND IT WILL BE MY LAST.",1

Airbnb support confirmed early checkout due to unlivable conditions – then refused refund,"I booked a 5-night stay in Germany through Airbnb. When I arrived, the apartment was in unacceptable condition: cobwebs, visible dirt, dead insects, a musty smell, and loud constant noise from neighboring guests. I documented everything with photos and videos and contacted Airbnb support within 2 hours of check-in.Airbnb support offered me two options:Stay and get a 30% refund for the remaining nightsLeave early and receive a refund for the unused nightsI chose the second option. Airbnb confirmed that I was allowed to check out early, and I left the apartment the next morning before 10:00 a.m. I submitted all relevant documentation and proof.Days later, Airbnb informed me that I would only receive €8.10 — just 10% of a single night — because I ""refused a cleaning offer."" This is misleading. I did not refuse cleaning in principle — I simply declined to let strangers into an apartment I was already occupying. The apartment was not fit for check-in in the first place.Airbnb closed the case, ignored their own communication, and refused further review. The host was also disrespectful, mocking my language and sending voice messages via WhatsApp. Airbnb failed to apply its own guest protection policies (AirCover) and left me with a meaningless refund.This case was handled unprofessionally and irresponsibly. I have now filed a complaint with the German Verbraucherzentrale (consumer protection agency).Update (July 1):After ongoing communication, documentation, and escalation, Airbnb eventually resolved the case fairly. I received a refund for all unused nights and a partial compensation for the first night and cleaning fee. Special thanks to Mostafa S. from Airbnb support, who personally took over and handled the matter with professionalism and genuine care.While I’m grateful for the resolution, it only happened after significant effort and frustration. The standard support flow was disappointing and ineffective.Rating updated to 3 stars to reflect the final outcome and the individual support I received – not the system as a whole.UPDATE: Host posted defamatory review, Airbnb refuses to remove itAfter Airbnb acknowledged my complaint and issued a refund, the host posted a public response falsely accusing me of lying and fabricating evidence. This directly contradicts Airbnb’s own decision in my favor.I followed all Airbnb support instructions to report the review. They told me it would be reviewed by a human, but the system rejected both of my removal attempts automatically — support knew this, yet insisted I try again. When I pointed out the manipulation, they claimed it was “out of their control” and closed the case.The defamatory review remains online. Airbnb allows this to happen, even after admitting the guest was right. Completely unacceptable.Due to this ongoing abuse and dishonesty, I have now permanently changed my rating to 1 star.UPDATE (Juli 19, Final):After weeks of fighting through Airbnb’s endless support loop — involving at least 6 agents, 3 case closures, two rejections of my review removal request (both handled by bots despite promises of human review), and a discrimination report that was dismissed despite clear evidence — I’ve finally received my full refund and had the host’s defamatory review removed.But here’s the catch:This resolution didn’t come from regular Airbnb support. It only happened after I contacted Airbnb’s Data Protection Office and escalated the case beyond their normal channels. Without this step — and the parallel complaints filed through EU consumer bodies — I’m convinced the platform would’ve buried it entirely.It took persistent escalation, documentation, and pressure via external platforms. Without that, none of this would’ve been resolved.This entire process has shown me what Airbnb really is: a host-centric, support-deflecting machine, where guests are left to fight uphill just to be treated fairly. Airbnb support is, in many cases, nothing more than a rotating wall of templates and apologies — absolutely useless without persistence and external visibility.I’m done wasting energy on this toxic swamp. Let this post be a warning to others.",1

Airbnb protects toxic hosts – guests are left powerless,"Airbnb protects toxic hosts – guests are left powerlessI’m honestly shocked by how Airbnb handles reviews. I was just a guest invited on a trip with my sister and mom, yet a rude and aggressive review from a horrible host now shows up on my profile. I wasn’t even allowed to leave a review in return because I wasn’t the main guest.The irony? Airbnb refunded part of the booking because the host violated their own policies – but still allows her nasty review to stay public. Meanwhile, when I left honest feedback for another filthy apartment, my review was quietly deleted. No explanation. No support. My case was just closed without a word.Airbnb has become a platform that protects manipulative hosts and punishes guests who speak up. The review system is broken and dangerous. This isn’t just unfair – it’s downright harmful. I’m done with this company.What once started as a company with a great idea has now turned into a dangerous Goliath mostly driven by corporate greed.",1

Worst Platform for Host,"Worst platform to list your place as they only care about guests and not hosts at all! I am 9 years on the platform, and now, some late guests they left bad reviews and the platform decided to delist my place. Guests are very demanding and if they have a problem they prefer to write a bad review instead of informing me. I did contact the support because I don't agree with some reviews and they told me to make an inquiry so they can review and delete it. I did some and they rejected it. It was like a bot reviewed my cased. And not only that, you cannot cancel a booking as a host without paying a fee and its 56 euros. That's outrageous. On 2017 wasn't like that and the support doesn't find any solution at all. Whenever I reached them, they didn't find my any solution at all. The support system is nonexistent and not helpful at all. The platfom became very famous and doesn't care about us, the hosts, at all.I reccomend new hosts to go to other platforms and not on Airbnb.Edit: I filed an objection and they denied it based only on guests reviews which most of them aren't true and they don't care at all even if you are 9 years on the platform. The platform wasn't like that on the day I started using it.",1

I’ve been an Airbnb host for years and…,"I’ve been an Airbnb host for years and I’ve never experienced a more blatant disregard for host protections than what just happened.A guest booked my non-refundable listing, then later claimed his daughter made the booking — after staying in contact, asking to rebook, and confirming details for 7 days. When I declined a refund, he went to his bank and claimed “unauthorized use.” Despite the full message trail proving it was not fraud, Airbnb canceled the reservation and refused to pay me — in clear violation of their own Terms.I received 6+ identical copy-paste responses, no evidence of chargeback, no defense of my side, and no accountability from Airbnb. This is not just bad customer service — it’s systemic failure to protect hosts, and it opens a huge loophole for scammers.If Airbnb cannot uphold basic contractual obligations for verified bookings, how can any host trust them with their property or income?I’m calling on @Airbnb to review this case properly, and I will continue to escalate until this is resolved. Hosts: beware of this new loophole — your strict policies mean nothing if Airbnb doesn’t enforce them.",1
I’ve b Airbnb sided with host despite no proof – even after a guest was injuredeen a loyal Airbnb user for over…,"I’ve been a loyal Airbnb user for over 3 years and never imagined I’d be writing this. But our recent experience has made it clear: Airbnb no longer protects guests from false claims, unsafe listings, or abusive charges.After a recent stay, our host submitted a $495 damage claim filled with unsupported accusations — including trash that wasn’t ours, generic “deep cleaning” charges (despite a $150 cleaning fee already paid), and damage that clearly existed before our arrival.One of the central accusations was that we broke a hammock — but we submitted photo proof showing that the ropes were already torn at the moment we arrived, and the first time someone sat in it, it collapsed.That person was injured. Now ask yourself: what if it had been a child? In one of the host’s own photos, a child is seen sitting in that partially broken hammock. If it had failed under a child — would Airbnb still charge us for “causing damage”? Or would they then finally hold the host accountable for unsafe property?We also provided proof that the host themselves asked us to bring in boxes already outside the property — boxes they later claimed were “ours.” Airbnb completely ignored this.Airbnb claims that hosts must provide evidence of damage caused by guests during the reservation. In this case, the host provided no valid timestamps or direct links to our stay, and still — Airbnb charged us.We were told we must pay or our card will be charged. So now, any host can submit unverified accusations, and the guest has to pay. That is a terrifying precedent and a dangerous shift in platform policy.Airbnb, I urge you to reconsider how you evaluate evidence. If this is the level of protection you offer to responsible, long-time guests, we will have to stop using the platform entirely — and warn others to do the same.Last message sent to Airbnb: [28 June 2025], no response as of [1 July 2025].",1
Family with Baby Left to Sleep in Car…,"Family with Baby Left to Sleep in Car After Airbnb Booking FailuresA young family returning from holiday was left stranded overnight in their car after a series of Airbnb booking failures left them without accommodation — despite having spent over £1,200 on the platform in a single day.The ordeal began when the family, including their one-year-old daughter, landed back in the UK from Thailand at 7am. Hoping for a smooth transition into their week in London, they promptly booked an Airbnb property nearby for £500. With check-in not allowed until 4pm, the family waited patiently, exhausted after a long-haul journey.But upon arrival at the property, they were shocked by what they encountered. The building’s hallways were cluttered with dirty laundry, broken furniture, and discarded mattresses. Inside the apartment, a foul smell lingered, and stains covered the curtains, sofa, and floors. The accommodation, they said, was clearly unfit for a child.They cancelled immediately, and while Airbnb assured them the £500 would be refunded, the platform advised it could take up to 15 days to process.Still in urgent need of somewhere to stay, the family booked a second Airbnb for £770. However, this booking was instantly cancelled. When the mother contacted Airbnb customer service, she was told the host had cancelled — although the host later confirmed they had never even received the booking details.Now left with two large payments pending and no access to funds, the family pleaded with Airbnb for immediate assistance.“I explained to them that I had no money left to book somewhere else. We were stranded,” said the mother. “They offered me a 20% discount voucher, which was pointless — I had no money left to use it.”After hours on the phone, a customer service agent finally told the mother that Airbnb would provide £500 towards a new booking. She quickly found a suitable property and sent over the details. But three hours later, she received a message stating that Airbnb would not be honouring the promise.By now, it was late in the evening. With no accommodation secured and nowhere else to turn, the family — including their baby — were forced to sleep in their car overnight.“I told them we needed somewhere safe and warm, and that my daughter needed hot water for her bottles. Their final response was simply: ‘We cannot help.’”The mother, who also suffers from fibromyalgia, described the experience as physically and emotionally draining. “It was humiliating and dangerous. We had just returned from a beautiful family holiday, and Airbnb put us in a vulnerable position with a baby — not because of anything we did wrong, but because of their own system errors.”She says she has been a loyal Airbnb user for years, often booking high-value properties for family trips, and never imagined such treatment was possible. “They completely failed us when we needed them the most.”Midnight Call Sparks Further OutrageAdding insult to injury, Airbnb only reached out meaningfully after the mother told them she would be sharing her story with the media.“At around 12am, after everything we’d been through, I received a call from Airbnb — conveniently only after I told them I’d be taking this to the newspapers,” she said. “Where was this urgency when my baby needed somewhere safe to sleep? Why didn’t they act hours earlier when it could’ve actually made a difference?”The family is now demanding accountability from the company, calling on Airbnb to improve its emergency support services — especially for families travelling with young children or people with medical conditions.",1

I recently had one of the worst…,"I recently had one of the worst experiences with Airbnb, not just because of the property, but because of how Airbnb support handled it.I checked into an apartment that was filthy, had dead bugs, mold, stained bedding, and a sewer smell. I reported everything within hours of arrival with photos, videos, and a full report. The conditions were clearly unsafe and violated Airbnb’s own AirCover policy.And yet — Airbnb support kept stalling. They repeatedly told me the refund was up to the host, even though AirCover is supposed to protect guests regardless of the host’s decision. I had to fight for hours, submit proof over and over, stay awake all night in an unlivable space, and escalate to multiple agents before they finally issued a refund.It should not take this much stress and persistence to get basic guest protections enforced. Airbnb markets safety and “peace of mind,” but they do everything they can to avoid responsibility when something goes wrong.I got my refund in the end — but only after being treated like I was the problem. I’ll think twice before booking with Airbnb again, and I would not trust AirCover without backup evidence and serious persistence.",1

The changes were not for the better, the whole house needed redecorating",1

The host?Unresponsive. Aironb? Useless - closed the case against our wishes.The apartment itself? Filthy. Cobwebs, grime, dust, broken handles. The second bedroom is a boiling shoebox with no curtains, backing onto noisy AC units (that didn't even work).Drainage is haunted — empty the sink, and the shower gurgles like something's about to crawl out.We got no sleep, spent our holiday chasing fans and support tickets, and had no help whatsoever.

Customer support has gone so far downhill :(,"Infuriating experience with AirBnB. The host required me to sign a short term lease outside of the platform as part of the registration process - after AirBnB had accepted my reservation. This lease was insanely one sided and included a clause that they could refuse to accommodate me for the night and change the dates without any refund to me. The host refused to issue me a refund when I disagreed with this.This is obviously insanely against AirBnB's policies, so I called support. It was customer support hell for at least 5 hours of my time trying to get the reservation cancelled and refunded. The phone agents literally could not understand what I was saying and refused to look at links to AirBnb's own policies that forbid this. Eventually, their higher level support agent was able to resolve the issue, but this was incredibly draining and took soooo much time.The sad thing is that I used to have great experiences with AirBnB years ago and their phone support used to be some of the best I've ever experienced. Clearly, customer service is now a bottom priority.",2

When asked why I was being charged, the agent was only able to say that it was for my next scheduled payment. When I asked again, they said it was due to my host's cancellation policy, which they could not tell me where or how exactly it was in the host's policy, considering I had already paid for the period. Then they said it was due to the company's policy, which they sent me, but that policy also did not state why I was being charged when I'd cancelled before my payment was due, and during a period of time I had already paid for.Consider using any of these companies - Booking.com, Vrbo, Expedia, Tripadvisor Rentals, FlipKey, Holiday Lettings, Marriott's Homes & Villas, HomeToGo, Sonder, Vacasa - instead of Airbnb.",1

HOST WARNING: Airbnb's Broken Support System 🚨,"As a long-standing, highly-rated Airbnb host, I’ve always upheld strict safety protocols, clear house rules, and a 5-star hosting standard.

London police report (as i had to report ) and house rule violations. Airbnb support seen the guests at fault and accommodation cancelled by them only, but the listings were still suspended, and no meaningful resolution was provided. My reputation and income are impacted — for enforcing safety rules Airbnb claims to support.💬 Hosts deserve fair treatment, not penalties for upholding safety and platform policies.📢 Airbnb, this is unacceptable. If you truly value your host community, we need real protections, not silence.It's just ridiculous. I used them as host and guests for last 9 years with almost all 5 star ratings.",1

NAVARRE airbnb,"I've rented through vrbo for 15 years with a perfect record. I've tried airbnb 4 times. This time was a huge mistake.  I reserved what I thought was a decent spot. I reserved it a couple of hours before arrival as we were going through and thought we may stay a few days in town. The owner was rude to begin with on messages.  I let that go as thats just the fact some people are short with you. . We arrived with barely a parking spot to get in. He lived there as well. Which we didnt realize. His vehicles were on the right. On the left was numerous old boats, boat trailers , motors & parts laying everywhere. We barely could fit in.. The place had good reviews. We walked in and It was much smaller than it looked. Basically a split level and someone had maybe cut it in half and made an apartment.  It was dark and basement type smell. The bedroom was very small. It was a 2 bedroom. I read too fast and didnt realize there was only 1 bath.  The pool had sand or dirt all around it and floating on it. The patio furniture was all rusted.  The only good thing was it was by the bay. The plave is not as pictured in the add. Anyway we thought we can't stay here. We instantly text and said if we decided to leave would we be refunded. He said yes. If you arent happy I will give all your money back. If you go ahead and leave so I don't have to pay cleaners. I said yes. We left.  Then after we left went to another place. He would not refund my money. He lied and ssid airbnb wasnt clearing his calender. Airbnb said he would not answer their calls or messages. I have every single conversation with him in screen shots. I have photos, call times, screen shots to prove everything I've said is 100% the truth. Airbnb would absolutely not help me. I called them numerous times, emailed, instantly messaged. Everything.

I am a host with AirBnB,"I am a host with AirBnB. I had a guest stay there and he sent a complaint about a small tear in one of the couches and the sink was scratched up from being old and the hand rail had a mount that needed to be replaced. I offered to come out and fix the hand rail and sink right away which the guest refused. The guest also said ""It was no rush"" and did not want me to come fix the situation, however I could drop off a new couch because I did buy a new one which I did.After the guest left he contacted AirBnB with literally about 4 pictures. One showed the sink, the other couch and the other the hand rail which he did not want me to fix until he left. They essentially gave him back most of his money of these 4 pictures even though he refused to let me come and fix the problem and even though I actually bought a brand new couch because of the small tear in the bottom of the one that was there.This is absurd situation as the guest refused to allow me to fix the other SMALL problems and AirBnB essentially allowed him to stay in my house for free because of these small issues that he refused to allow me to rectify.",1
Bait and switch after Airbnb canceled my reservation...,"Woke up one week before my vacation to find Airbnb had canceled my reservation.  Called and was told the host was ""non-comiant"" with the platform.  I was told I would receive a 15% coupon which I negotiated up to 20% of my canceled booking, amounting to around $500.  I was told the coupon would be sent to my account.  I frantically spent all day searching for a new place and found one just listed that met my needs.  Fearing I would lose it I booked it immediately and called support to find out about the coupon.  I was ignored, I was gaslighted, and I was told they would only give me $300.  No why even though I asked.  I asked if my previous offer was documented.  He replied yes, but they could only give me $300.  Why?  Because that's what they can offer me.  I up to today have been totally happy with Airbnb, but this....canceling my reservation without contacting me, providing an offer to me as compensation then changing that offer with no reason why, and expecting me to be ok with that is a hard NO.

The second and the only other method is to use your advanced mobile device and deal with an app which I do not know how to do since I do not own an advanced mobile device and only own a $10 mobile phone without browsing or app ability.

Unacceptable Handling of a Valid Refund Case,"I had a recent experience where I booked an Airbnb listing that was misrepresented in key ways: the internet was unusably slow (2 Mbps on a good attempt, failed entirely on others), the grass was overgrown well above local safety recommendations (posing a tick hazard), and the host admitted the Wi-Fi often needs to be manually reset in a shed — a recurring issue.After raising these concerns on the day of check-in and deciding not to stay, I was accused by the host of being a “scammer.” Despite providing clear documentation (photos, Wi-Fi tests, screenshots of messages), I was passed around by Airbnb support with no resolution. Over 10 calls, repeated requests to resubmit evidence, and 10 days later, the case was closed with no refund, citing the host’s denial as final.This experience shows a clear lack of guest protection. Airbnb’s support system was disorganized, dismissive, and ultimately sided with the host despite hard evidence. Very disappointed and will not be using the platform again.",1

Then I asked why I am getting to know this now, all they could say is they’re just getting the information now. I requested for some type of compensation and the next thing was that my booking was cancelled. Called Airbnb and requested for compensation as the prices were now above £1300 for similar accommodation and location. Airbnb offered me £156, what a shame. 2nd time I’m using Airbnb and might be the final time I’ll be using them.Got similar experience with booking,com and I was offered over £600 compensation due to how close it was to my check-in.Airbnb it’s a shame you will do this to yr clients and put them in very difficult financial situations.",1

This clearly violates Airbnb’s promise of price transparency.Despite documented issues and even confirmation from the host, Airbnb offered only a partial refund – part of which came as a voucher, which I did not agree to.

NO explanation as to WHY they STILL haven't addressed your problem.  Just 'we are investigating and will get back to you'.  It is beyond frustrating.  Customer service is DEAD.  I remember when Airbnb first began, and it was truly about PEOPLE meeting and getting to know PEOPLE from all over the world.  Now it's all about GREED.

We had to relocate to a hotel the same night, and booked a new Airbnb the next day. We shared both receipts with Airbnb as proof.Despite our long-time use of Airbnb for corporate travel and despite the very real safety risk, Airbnb denied our refund request, claiming there was no “proof.”We respectfully find this decision unacceptable.Airbnb’s foremost priority is — and should be — guest safety. In situations where that safety is compromised, even without a specific incident being recorded, guests should not be penalized for acting to protect themselves.We want to emphasize that we have absolutely no incentive to fabricate or exaggerate this experience. We are a loyal Airbnb customer and use the platform regularly for corporate travel. Had we not truly feared for our team’s safety, we would not have canceled the reservation or submitted this request.We are now left with not only the financial loss of the unused night, but also disappointment in how our genuine concern was dismissed. The absence of physical evidence should not outweigh the reality of a threatening atmosphere that any reasonable person would find distressing.We ask that this matter be reviewed again at a higher level, with the understanding that guest safety is not always measurable by photos or reports — sometimes it is simply about feeling secure, which in this case, was clearly absent.Airbnb must take genuine safety concerns seriously — not just when there’s an incident, but when the environment itself presents a clear threat.",1
Awful company and even worse host!,"This company only cares about making money and not holding their hosts to account. Had an awful experience from a host who cancelled on us, with no visible consequences for the host. Airbnb were not bothered about resolving and dealing with host. I’ve deactivated my account and will never use again.",1
Awful awful awful company,Awful awful awful company. We rented a place for a week in Lake Tahoe for our anniversary and upon checking in noticed a terrible smell. We opened the windows and turned on the fan to air it out while we unpacked to air it out and it would not go away. We couldn’t spend an entire week in a place that gave me a headache after an hour of airing it out and so alerted the host of the issue and that we were going to cancel the reservation and book a hotel. The host and Airbnb are refusing to give us a refund and so we are out $2k. Their site will also not let me leave a review on the unit to warn future renters. We will never rent from Airbnb again.,1
I had an Airbnb stay I couldn’t use due…,"I had an Airbnb stay I couldn’t use due to a sudden flight cancellation caused by regional unrest. I contacted Airbnb, submitted documentation, and followed their process, but they did absolutely nothing. The host refused to help, and Airbnb support kept sending robotic replies. No flexibility, no understanding, and no real support. This was a horrible experience for a loyal customer.",1
wouldn’t recommend even if they pay me!,"Arrived at my Airbnb after a flight delay with my family including a 5 year old to find out we had been double booked. I contacted my host who explained that she had told Airbnb and she was not aware of any rentals through them and that she was going to contact Airbnb in morning for a refund.My family and I were left in the street and by then it was midnight and the thunderstorm over Paris had picked up. We were frantically trying to find a hotel with availability near by and taxis to carry us there. We got soaked to our underwear trying to do this. It was a horrid experience.When we got to the hotel, I immediately contacted Airbnb to request an explanation as to what on earth just happened!! It was 2am and I was wide awake from earlier events!The hotel couldn’t accommodate for a further two nights (we were in Paris for 3 nights total) so we had to move hotels the next day. We were booked at Versailles palace so had to let our luggage with us on public transport, luckily the palace had lockers to use. By then our wet clothes were packed as they are…The next day I receive a call with someone who is clearly uninterested in my dissatisfaction and was trying to wrap up the case with a refund. I requested an explanation and an apology and explained I would be sending receipts for additional expenses incurred like taxis and hotel Vs Airbnb difference.I sent this and was then told they are unable to meet my ‘demands’ of £300 refund. Cut a long story short and 3 days later I spoke to 3 different advisors and each had a different response. I ended up complaining on social media and received my payout this morning eventually.Airbnb is good when things go smooth. One mistake by then and they couldn’t care less and don’t want to help. I found people spoken to have no understanding at all and treated my case like a business transaction. There was 0 care and humanity!In conclusion, I wouldn’t recommend even if they pay me!",1
In 2024 i tried booking with a host,"In 2024 i tried booking with a host. No response What so ever - even after Airbnb tried to Contact Them. This year 2025 I requested the booking in advance and reached out to the host multiple times months prior to our travel. Still no response.I feel it is neglectful of Airbnb to allow a host to be on the platform when they don’t accept any bookings. As one of their so called ambassadors with an account that’s only praised, never any bad remarks I would have expected them to handle the situation better, but no.Really considering never using Airbnb again, as this is the 4th time I’ve had an issue. First these two. Then a booking where we arrived and the entire house was beyond dirty and it took them 10 days to come clean, and then another time with a host who wasn’t even allowed to be a host in the complex so we dealt with a lot of angry neighbors. Only once has Airbnb stepped up to help. ONCE‼️Airbnb is turning into a shit show. Find another way of booking because it’s either this or they’ll cancel the booking right before arrival.",1
Airbnb Protects Rule Breakers,"Airbnb Protects Rule Breakers, Not HostsI’m a host on Airbnb, and my recent experience with their support team was deeply disappointing.A guest booked my property claiming he would be staying with his wife. Instead, he showed up with a friend and another woman — three people instead of two, clearly planning to throw a party, which violates my house rules. I refused to check them in due to the false information.In response, the guest left a negative review that had nothing to do with what actually happened.I contacted Airbnb support to request the removal of this unfair review. For a week, I received nothing but automated responses. Eventually, a representative called me, but their English was extremely difficult to understand. Soon after, my case was closed without any proper explanation.The only answer I received was:“According to our policy, the guest acted appropriately.”So, lying about the number of guests, breaking the rules, and posting a fake review is considered appropriate?As a host, I feel completely unprotected. Airbnb shows no real concern for facts, fairness, or host rights.Their policies are vague, support is unhelpful, and decisions are irrational.This platform no longer feels like a trustworthy place for responsible hosts.",1
In my opinion I would not ever book again through Airbnb the last minute.,"In my opinion, if an agency cannot contact its own clients and serve its customers, then why is such an agency needed? People can book their stay directly. This is what happened to my family when we booked a place to relax for a weekend by the sea and the answer was that the owner did not have time for it and the agency with its rules could not contact him, so we were left with nothing. We waited 24 hours for a response to inform us that the stay was canceled. I would not recommend booking through Airbnb to anyone.",1

Airbnb is a complete joke.,"Got kicked out after a small gathering - fine, we left immediately. Then they charged me $800 for items nobody touched, items I had locked away before guests even arrived. I got charged $800 for damages that “me and my guests” made. I explained everything, but their so called “support” kept demanding “evidence” like I was supposed to predict I’d be falsely accused!! On top of that, I had to deal with a racist neighbour calling me slurs. Airbnb couldn’t care less. Absolute trash. Never using this garbage platform again.",1
* Traumatic experience in air bnb place,"**Title:** Traumatic experience in Pierrefitte-sur-Seine - Paria  – targeted threat in Airbnb apartmentMy family and I (including three children) stayed in an apartment in **Pierrefitte-sur-Seine**, just outside of Paris, through Airbnb from June 16 to June 18, 2025. On the morning of **June 18**, just before check-out, we were about to leave the apartment when a man and a woman came out of the elevator and approached us in the hallway.They first asked if we were tourists, and then if the apartment was an Airbnb. They claimed to be police officers. I asked for their badges, but instead, **both of them showed us pistols hidden under their clothing** and said they needed to check the terrace.I quickly took my sister-in-law back into the apartment and locked the door as fast as I could. They rang the bell for a while, then eventually left the building. **They only approached our door** – it felt like a targeted encounter.What made it more disturbing: the building was protected by **three secure entrances** that could only be opened with a key or access code. How they gained access remains unclear.**We left the apartment in a state of panic with our children.** Our car was in the underground garage where there was no mobile reception. I was so afraid that I didn't even call the police – I just wanted to get my family out of there as quickly and safely as possible.**Airbnb advised me to write a review and request a refund. I don’t want a refund.** What feels absurd is being expected to write a ""review"" after such a traumatic experience. I reached out to Airbnb so they would **remove this dangerous listing from their platform** to protect other travelers.**But unfortunately, the apartment is still available.** In my opinion, this is **deeply irresponsible** on Airbnb’s part. They are supposed to think about our safety – but they don’t, or at least not enough. After what happened, **how can I trust Airbnb again when this listing remains online?**This is not a complaint in the usual sense – it is a *serious warning*. Please stay alert. Trust your instincts. Nothing is more important than your safety and your family’s",1
Been complaining to airbnb so they stop…,Been complaining to airbnb so they stop overcharging us for service fee although I've set everything up the right way.

Outrageous experience,"Outrageous experience! You should be ashamed! I even wrote the guy before I booked a flat. As soon as he said yes available then I booked it. I guess not! Someone booked it around the same time. Airbnb or the guy took my money and left me with no flat to rent. They said it wasn't available. OK why would you take my money over a a place is not available anyway? 😡😡😡Customer service says it takes nearly 7 working days! Liars, cheating company! I only had enough to book a place!!! You should be ashamed! I just checked the flat is still available to book! The liar host  advised me to book somewhere else that belongs to him! AVOID!",1
DONT USE,Rented an air bnb through them completely opposite of the listing. Had mold leaks in the roof every light in the house flickering off & on loss of power fully,1
Their customer service is below 1 star.,In order to secure my reservation I needed to verify my identity.  I tried multiple times and it simply would not let me.  My account also said I was verified when I wasn't so it wouldn't let me verify and it also wouldn't let me reserve since I wasn't.  Called customer service for them to basically tell me there wasn't anything they could do.  My advice is to use a website that actually works.,1
Should vet info,Goodbye guys. Just ask the host for photos and don’t assume their 110 transactions outweigh the customer’s 17,1
Wait for refund.,"Could not complete booking as would not accept a valid passport as ID. Said my money was being ( note BEING ) refunded. When I contacted them about delay a week later, only THEN did they even start the refund. Please save yourself hassle and find another way of booking.",1
🚩 Airbnb failed to protect me as a guest and ignored its own policies,"I booked a stay where the host tried to charge me an $80 pet fee and extra guest charges after booking. Neither fee was included in the price breakdown at checkout, as Airbnb policy requires. The host tried to sneak these in after the fact.I provided Airbnb with clear proof: screenshots of the price breakdown, policy links, and a timeline of events. Instead of addressing this, Airbnb support:❌ Gave me conflicting, templated responses❌ Misrepresented their own policies❌ Claimed that simply “mentioning” a fee in a listing made it valid (it doesn’t — fees must be included at checkout)❌ Ignored that no proper alteration request for extra charges was ever submitted or approvedThey only refunded me after I fought tooth and nail — and after trying to force me to accept a coupon I didn’t want. Their so-called senior managers closed my case with empty apologies and no accountability for the host.If you want a booking platform that enforces its own rules and protects guests, Airbnb isn’t it.",1
AirBNB does not follow their guest refund policy,"The house I stayed at had multiple issues including major water damage and a mouse infestation. The water damage caused us to leave. I understand that due to the long term stay policy, I technically owe the next 30 days. However, under the guest refund policy, AirBNB should refund me entirely. Instead they are continuously harassing me about further charges for the rest of the reservation. Their customer service is rude and will not help you. I’ve continuously been debating them and they keep reading me a script. All I asked was to not continue the next payments but now due to the harassment, I want all my money back. I will never recommend AirBNB to anyone.",1
Dont use Airbnb. I rented a property for 3 weeks in Ohio…,"I rented a property for 3 weeks in Ohio Columbus. From the first day I reported multiple issues to the host from filthy rooms, issues with AC, non functioning equipment.After 1 week of putting up with it I finally reached out to air bnb to complain and to request a cancellation due to the conditions. Absolutely no help whatsoever. The property was not advertised, after looking back on reviews the cleanliness was raised by other renters and clearly nothing was done but the host still maintained the super host status. Absolutely appalling behaviour from air bnb. Looking at the trust pilot reviews it seems they just dont care about there customers..shame on you air bnb",1
Misleading support,"I had a disappointing experience with Airbnb — not just because of the stay itself, but because of how the platform misled me during the support process.I reported serious concerns to Airbnb early in my stay. A support representative told me I’d be eligible for a 30% refund for the entire reservation — around 20 nights — and advised me to reach back out at the end to claim it. At no point was I told that the only way to receive that refund would be by requesting it directly from the host.Based on this information, I shaped my actions accordingly: I didn’t escalate further, didn’t press the host, and didn’t gather additional proof — trusting that Airbnb would handle it as they said.After my stay ended, Airbnb reversed its position. They refunded me only for 2 nights and told me the rest would be up to the host. This was the first time I heard that the platform would not take responsibility for the full refund they initially promised.If I had been given accurate information, I would have acted differently. Instead, I was misled and denied a fair outcome — not because of what happened in the apartment, but because of how Airbnb handled the situation.Be cautious: the outcome of your case may hinge more on the individual handling it than on any transparent or reliable process.",1

They refuse to even look at it u till I provide MY date of birth and MY payment method ( I have no idea what this is ans the account has been inactive for so many years).I asked to speak to a supervisor. I was transferred to someone who claimed his name was Batman. He then continued to talk really weird rubbish at me. Apparently this company has no way of investigating fraud.I am appalled.

"2 cancelled bookings - 1 day before, and 1 week before. Costing over £3k in damages and left without anywhere to stay tonight","We booked 2 bookings for elderly parents visiting London (7 months in advance), and in walking distance to our home, and both cancelled last minute. One was 4 days before the booking, one was as 1 day before the booking.I spent over 24 hours on the phone to try and find a replacement and left without anywhere for one day, and had to pay an additional £3k for a 2 week booking. The refund policy means they only refund you the cost of the original  booking (and sometimes up to 20% of the additional cost of a new booking). But, at last minute there is naturally nothing available.The second booking cancelled 1 day before, and again we would have to pay more to find anything close to suitable.Any other travel company would look after guests when there is something wrong with the accommodation - book something at the same or better.Air Bnb policies mean you have to pay when a host cancels, and if you’re lucky you might find somewhere else to stay.We didn’t find anywhere to live today, and have been left in the lurch with a refund that will arrive in 3 days.Please don’t ever book air Bnb for any important trips you can’t afford to cancel, or if you aren’t willing and able to cover additional costs for a new booking if your host cancels.I’ve been left in debt of over £3k, lost days and nights of sleep, and now don’t have anywhere for my mother to stay for the next week.This is not acceptable and suggest no one books air Bnb until these policies change - hosts who cancel last minute should be required to cover the additional cost for a new booking the guests agree is the same or better than quality.They suggested my mum stay in a 8 bedroom dorm 6 miles away from me as a replacement.Their current policies when you book and are treated badly by bad hosts, you must cover the cost to fix what they cancel.  Please keep this in mind.Here are the two bookings who cancelled last minute to ensure you avoid them.This host cancelled less than 1 week before a 2 week booking, booked 7 months ago. The original cost was £3,100 and we had to pay an additional £3,000+ to cover another booking that was suitable - with almost nothing available at such last minute notice for a long period in london in June. Do not book this one: “Chelsea Snug with Garden”, hosted by Jonny.This host cancelled 1 day before arrival for a 1 week stay which originally cost £1,300, with no rationale or replies to any messages - do not book this one. Property by Capital is the managing host, “ 1 bedroom apartment in Chelsea - RCG”",1

Regretting the thousands of pounds of service fees that I have paid to them over the years. At this point even if my account were to be reinstated I would happily use other booking platforms over Airbnb, due to the lack of care for longstanding clientele.

This last stay the bedroom smelled like crack smoke. I sent a complaint and Airbnb said I could leave and they would help me find a new place. My family of six packed everything up and left. I then asked Airbnb to help me find a new place and all they did was send me a link to listings in that area, which were all double the price of the one I left. Airbnb told me they couldn’t help me with the price. After hours on the phone they said they would send me 20% off so I could book the cheapest listing which was double what I had paid.

Lovely stay at Kingfisher lodge at the Bodmin holiday park Cornwall.,"Booked Kingfisher lodge in Bodmin holiday park Cornwall, through AirBnBThey were quick to answer and the holiday lodge host Julia emailed me within the hour with her contact details and answered any queries I had very quickly. The lodge itself was very clean and well presented with everything you might need for a self catering holiday, if you don’t want to cook there is a restaurant on the site, yes the menu is fairly basic but it’s well cooked and tasty, the restaurant staff were all very friendly and helpful, and more importantly you can take your dog with you into the bar area.The lodge sits in a lovely peaceful park, with some beautiful fishing lakes.We will definitely be booking to stay again",5
If I could give 0 stars,"If I could give 0 stars, I would. A fake listing meant I had to request a refund. Airbnb sent the refund on the same day, but the refund never cleared. After 12 days, I contacted my bank, and gave them a reference number given to me by Airbnb. The numbers came back with empty transactions - refunds 'sent' but with no monetary value. I proved this to Airbnb, who told me to wait a further 10 days for funds to clear! I waited, and nothing. My bank told me that Airbnb needed to re-send the refund correctly as there was nothing they could do on their end. Airbnb simply refused, and kept telling me time and time again that they had already sent my money and it was no longer their issue. £415 is nothing to a multi-billion pound company, but its a whole lot to a working class disabled person. I've incurred debt on my overdraft and credit card due to being £415 down for so long (and after having to panic book a last minute hotel for my trip, which I then had no money to enjoy). Airbnb are scummy! To allow fake listings and then to also refuse to send refunds is truly disgusting. Avoid at ALL costs.",1

Horrible and traumatizing experience…,"Horrible and traumatizing experience with Airbnb. It’s this actually my second time having a bad experience with this company. I wanted to give a second try but it was WORSE than the first. I requested a full refund for my reservation which I canceled due to serious safety concerns and lack of support from the host.A day after making the reservation, 6 weeks Prior to my arrival, I contacted the host to ask specific questions about the area — including how far the listing was from town and what transportation options were available. These were essential for me to feel confident and safe in accessing the location. Unfortunately, I did not receive a response at all. the host was unhelpful in addressing my concerns.Given this lack of communication and the unclear nature of the listing, I felt genuinely unsafe continuing with the reservation — especially in a country unfamiliar to me and I canceled to protect my personal safety, and I believe this falls within the scope of Airbnb’s Guest Refund Policy, which includes:“Travel Issues” such as misrepresentation of location or a host failing to provide reasonable access or support. I summited a resolution request, it’s been more than 72hr, and Airbnb has not reach out to Host as per one of their customer service representative I spoke w/ a few hours ago. Airbnb refuses to give me a refund after I spent $1600 with this company. Yes, I cancelled w/this particular Host, when ahead and made 2 other reservations a different Host.I am requesting that my case be escalated to Airbnb’s Trust & Safety team. I am happy to provide full documentation, including:Screenshots of my messages to the hostDetails about the lack of responseTimeline of my communication and cancellation.This company should protect its guests as much as its host.DO NOT trust a company that only cares about getting your money which is what it looks like with this one.

Extremely Disappointed with Airbnb’s Handling and Lack of Transparency,"I’ve been using Airbnb for years and always had great experiences—until now. After a terrible stay at a property in Japan, I tried to leave a review within the 14-day window, only to find that the review link was already expired. I had an email from Airbnb clearly stating that June 17 was the final day to submit my review, yet the system locked me out hours before that without any explanation.When I contacted Airbnb support, not only were they completely unhelpful, but they also blamed the system and told me it was based on the listing’s time zone—a detail that was never mentioned in the reminder emails. That is incredibly misleading and unacceptable for a global platform like this. Users should not have to guess time zones when writing reviews.I work in tech. I know systems can be overridden—don’t insult your users by saying it’s “system generated and no one can change it.” It’s not a technical limitation. It’s a lack of accountability.To make things worse, Airbnb showed no interest in escalating the case or taking responsibility, even though I had proof I was within the window. I was effectively silenced from sharing a negative experience due to Airbnb’s lack of transparency and rigid, inconsistent policies.If this is how Airbnb protects hosts and fails guests, I will absolutely not be using the platform again—and I’ll be sharing this experience publicly to warn others. Truly disappointed.",1
Title: Absolutely Unacceptable — Airbnb Has Completely Betrayed Its Customers,"My experience with Airbnb has been an utter disgrace. I booked a place that was supposed to have two bedrooms with two beds. Instead, what I received was a lie — only one bed in two bedrooms, and the host claimed it was a ""misunderstanding"" caused by translation issues from French to English. This was clearly a cover-up for a place that was grossly misrepresented.We arrived and stayed less than four hours before realizing the accommodation was completely unacceptable. We had no choice but to leave immediately and scramble to find a hotel, wasting our time and money. I spent nearly two weeks arguing with Airbnb’s customer service, and all I got was a pathetic offer of a $100 coupon — which is nothing compared to the $1,100 I paid for a five-night stay. After relentless arguing, they finally offered me $250 in compensation, but that’s an insult given the situation.This company has become a total farce. They no longer care about their customers — only about lining their pockets and protecting hosts at all costs. They accept anyone and anything just to fill bookings, regardless of the quality or truthfulness of the listings. Their customer service is nonexistent, and their handling of this issue was a complete joke.I am beyond disappointed — I am furious. I will NEVER use this service again. Airbnb has become a scam, a failure, and a betrayal of trust. Stay far away — they don’t care about you.",1

Once they get their positive review, the start rambling on about how bad conditions you left the house in, how you disrespected the house rules etc. And the worst part is, airbnb does absolutely nothing about this victimisation of the guests.

The greed of the company really shows how they don't care for customers and would rip them off as quickly as possible.

Just said make a different reservation as a solution.,1
Amenities May Not Be Available,"Prior to being accepted for the AirBnb I was asked several questions by the host regarding the reason for my visit. 5/23/25 I shared that I was visiting my son for his birthday & how important it was as I had not seen him in several years. Friday 6/6/25, the host first contact came in an hour after check-in, while we were still on the road. I was told the pool would not be available until ""Hopefully"" that Sunday. That meant 2 out of the 3 days booked we could not use the pool, but he would be over in the morning to have it fixed. He also mentioned that the renter before me had the same complaint. That meant he knew the pool was unavailable but failed to notify me, in order to give me the courtesy of finding another place to spend my son's birthday. I tried to wait until the morning, but AirBnb said I would have to pay over $600 for the night in a private pool rental with no pool access. Unfortunately, the home was also not cleaned properly. While the hot tub had smudges of dirt in it and unclean walls and rings on the sink, the other bathroom was shockingly unkept with hair in the drain, filthy shower floor & dirty rugs. There was a smell coming from the garbage disposal and obvious cup rings on the table and counter tops.  When I messaged the host, I could see 1/3 reading it. There was no response for the next hour or so via msg. By the time I got a response they were only concerned with photos. No regard to rectifying the issue I was only told that the host has canceled your rental, leave the property. It was 11 pm after a 12-hour drive. We were exhausted and put out on the streets. I am deeply dissatisfied with both the 3 host of the property & AirBnb. They ruined our evening and weekend plans. :-(",1
Disappointed at the very least,"I am very disappointed after jumping through all sorts of hoops to get a reservation then their not making the connection with my bank, not informing me, and losing the reservation. At this late date I cannot find another at a reasonable price.",1
"Rigid Policies, Zero Backup — Airbnb Left Me Stranded","I’ve used Airbnb for years, but my latest experience shows the platform no longer stands behind its guests. I accidentally booked the wrong date for a Fairfield Inn & Suites stay via Airbnb. Within minutes I contacted the host, Jason, asking only for a date change—no refund, just one night moved. Jason hid behind “policy” and told me to sort it out with Airbnb.Airbnb Support confirmed they spoke to Jason, yet claimed their hands were tied because he “didn’t authorize any change.” In other words, the host blamed Airbnb, Airbnb blamed the host, and I was stuck paying nearly US $200 for a room I never used.Airbnb markets itself as a customer-centric platform, but when a straightforward, good-faith mistake occurs, it provides zero protection or flexibility. Instead of stepping in to resolve an obvious gap in service, Airbnb let rigid policies trump common sense and basic hospitality.After this fiasco I’ve lost all confidence in the brand. I won’t be booking through Airbnb again, and I’ll advise friends and colleagues to stay away until the company proves it can actually safeguard guests when hosts refuse to cooperate.",1
Airbnb reviews are irrelevant,"As a long-time Superhost, I’m extremely disappointed by Airbnb’s refusal to remove clearly unfair 1-star reviews. In multiple cases, guests never even checked in — either because Airbnb themselves canceled the reservation due to safety concerns, or the guest missed their flight and had to cancel last-minute.Despite these situations being completely out of my control, Airbnb chose to keep these damaging reviews on my profile, unfairly hurting my reputation and affecting future bookings. Their system offers no real protection to hosts in these situations, and their support team seems unwilling or unable to apply basic logic or fairness. This is not the kind of treatment a committed host should receive. Airbnb’s failure to act has left me questioning their commitment to supporting hosts at all.",1
Do not trust ratings in Airbnb website!,One cannot trust Airbnb rating system: some hosts even offer discount if you give them a five star rating.,1
very stupid nightly price system,"very stupid nightly price system, in many cases you wil see the nightly price and then they will show that the price is the sum of property price + airbnb service fees.but is necesary to check ALWAYS with your math if the total amount is corect, becose many times if you check nightly price that you will paid is bigger.For these reason in will NEVER use airbnb.com",1
Unacceptable and distressing customer service,"Unfortunately our apartment developed a leak during our 5 night stay in Barcelona. This meant the water needed to be switched off at the mains and we would have no running water for showering, toilets etc. We were advised by the host to contact Airbnb about relocating and did so over the phone.After the initial call, the customer service representative, Micheal, communicated via live chat. Michael modified our stay from 5 nights to 1 night, providing a refund for the remaining 4 nights. He informed us that we would be entitled to 20% compensation to help relocate. This seemed reasonable, as we had booked 6 months ago and Barcelona was busy with a number of events, meaning limited affordable accommodation options were available.However, Michael told us 20% would be £99, on a ~£2.5k booking. I questioned this, and he said that the booking had been modified to 1 night and so we were only entitled to compensation for one night. Without any explanation, and without my consent, he had modified the booking in a  way that reduced the compensation due to us. Calling back, a separate customer service agent was much more helpful. By this time it was 8pm and the agent told us we could book hotel accommodation at a cost of one night’s Airbnb +$200, and that they’d be in touch to help provide alternative accommodation in the morning. I read a message to this agent confirming the content of our conversation, which he agreed to, and which I then put into the live chat as a record. Michael disagreed with the information the second agent had provided over the chat, insisting we could not book a hotel and that the maximum compensation would be £99. A third call to Airbnb was made, the agent this time said that both agents were right, but the hotel accommodation would be subject to approval and that was something that she couldn’t do in the phone. She said that Michael had made a mistake by modifying the booking to 1 night but, that now that had been done, he was correct that we were only entitled to 1 night compensation. Although she said this was Airbnb’s mistake, she said there was nothing they could do about it. I asked to speak to a manager. When the manager finally called me back (by this stage nearly 10pm) he was very helpful. We explained the situation and awaited a further call back from him. In the meantime Michael called and insisted we could only get £99 compensation, disregarding the fact this had been escalated above him and that the manager had said they would be able to reach a better solution. We eventually received a call from the manager, who offered a £500 Airbnb voucher, which was slightly more than 20% of the cost of the stay. By this stage it was 11:30pm. Thankfully the host let us stay that night at their apartment (with no water), as relocating at this time of night would be impossible. We were able to find somewhere on booking.com at a reasonable price to relocate for the remaining 3 nights. We now have the Airbnb voucher which we will need to use within 12 months, so I guess it has still cost us money but we can use that for another stay.While the end resolution was acceptable, it was a truly horrible experience. Michael’s behaviour and unwillingness to take accountability for his error in modifying the stay, in a way that reduced the compensation due to us by ~£400, was unacceptable. His attitude was appalling and the experience caused a lot of distress. If the host hadn’t been willing to let us stay, the 23:30 resolution would have left us without accommodation for the night. As it was, staying without water was sub-optimal but at least we had somewhere to sleep. Providing the relocation assistance as an Airbnb voucher, although not entirely unreasonable, significantly reduced the options available to us to relocate with no notice. In the end we paid the extra to book with another provider and will have to use the voucher to recoup that expense on a future trip, despite having zero desire to use Airbnb again after this experience. Sadly based on other reviews, this kind of experience is incredibly common.",1
En tant qu’hôte Avis négatif sur Airbnb – Hôte profondément déçu,"En tant qu’hôte Airbnb, je suis extrêmement déçu par cette plateforme.À chaque location, j’ai constaté que des objets disparaissaient régulièrement de mon studio, et que d’autres étaient endommagés à la fin des séjours. Malgré mes signalements répétés, aucune mesure concrète n’a été prise.Mais deux cas en particulier ont rendu la situation intenable :Un locataire a pris les clés du logement et ne les a jamais rendues. Airbnb n’a strictement rien fait pour m’assister.Une locataire a gravement endommagé le studio et affirme avoir été agressée par deux individus qui ont aussi volé les clés. Cela a nécessité un changement immédiat de la serrure, et j’ai transmis les factures. Aucune réponse ni remboursement.Airbnb n’a jamais proposé de solution ou même de conseil.Aucun suivi, aucune réactivité, aucune protection. Airbnb ne prend pas ses responsabilités envers les hôtes.Il est clair que ce qui compte pour Airbnb, c’est avant tout leur commission, pas la sécurité ni la satisfaction des hôtes.Résultat : un investissement perdant, une expérience épuisante, et un sentiment d’abandon total.Je déconseille fortement Airbnb à tout hôte qui cherche un minimum de sérieux et de sécurité.Negative review of Airbnb – Deeply disappointed host:As an Airbnb host, I am extremely disappointed with this platform.With each booking, I noticed that items regularly disappeared from my studio, and others were found damaged after guests left. Despite my repeated reports, no concrete action was ever taken.But two specific cases made the situation unbearable:One guest took the keys to the property and never returned them. Airbnb did absolutely nothing to assist me.Another guest severely damaged the studio and claimed she was assaulted by two individuals who also stole the keys. This required an immediate lock change, and I submitted all related invoices. Still, no response and no reimbursement.Airbnb never offered any solution or even advice.No follow-up, no responsiveness, no protection. Airbnb refuses to take responsibility for its hosts.It’s clear that what matters most to Airbnb is their commission—not the safety or satisfaction of their users.In the end, this was a losing investment, a draining experience, and left me with a deep sense of abandonment.I strongly advise against using Airbnb for any host seeking professionalism, security, and real support.",1
AVOID! 10 Years and over 39 properties - they left me in a dangerous apartment and out of money.,"!AVOID USING IN JAPAN!I have been a customer for 10+ years and purchased 39 Airbnbs. I never once complained about one. I even have 3 more booked already. (These will be the last ones I use)I arrived in an airbnb in Tokyo and immediately noticed the apartment was not clean at all (a lot of dust and dirt everywhere) and had rising damp issues. I read the Airbnb policy and messaged the host. The host ignored me for over 24 hours.I noticed the room felt so damp and also began to notice that my throat was sore and my girlfriend was caughing a lot - when we arrived there were little 'water collection' devices and a dehumidifier running, so the host clearly knew there was an issue.I looked around and searched under posters and saw a lot of black mold and worse and worse damp issues - the apartment was disgusting and the level of black mold is proven to be dangerous to health.I then messaged Airbnb directly explaining the situation and took pictures. They took so long to respond and when they did they didn't really say anything useful, that we had to sleep another night there. In the morning we told Airbnb we would be leaving because we were concerned for our health. No response for OVER 9 HOURS! I had to book a hotel. (the cheapest possible accommodation I could find, because I didn't have R$5000+ extra in my budget, but I would have to spend it)Airbnb had offered no help, no alternative, no money. Eventually after we moved to the hotel, they offered me close to a full refund which I accepted. Only then to hours later tell me they actually would not give me that and had 'made a mistake' and would give me much much less than I paid for the original airbnb and less than it cost me to get the hotel and mainly it would come in Airbnb credits!?I have followed their policy, sent countless photos and explanations, yet now I have paid twice for accommodation at no small cost, due solely to Airbnb's lack of responses and allowing of a dangerous property to be on their website. So now I have lost well over R$5,000 and they are refusing to refund me this money. Not to mention the countless messages, being stuck without properties or knowing what to do all day, having to move about, destroying my vacation - all I asked for was actually in the end less than a full refund! Less! And I still was denied.I'm genuinely shocked, as for such a small cost to Airbnb, they could have prevented losing a long time, frequent customer who has spent hundreds of thousands of reais with them and prevented receiving a lawsuit.It was very clear from talking to the cleaner and seeing how the host was running dehumidifiers (filthy ones by the way) and hiding mold behind posters that the host was very very aware of the mold and damp issues before we got to the property. It now is making me believe that Airbnb may be very aware of this risk too, as the property is still available on their website despite me sending countless photographs as evidence.",1

Airbnb Support For Hosts Is A Joke!!,"Horrible customer service for hosts. Guests are allowed to write retaliatory reviews when you won’t give their money back, because they have allergies and said the NC weather bothered them during their stay (yeah because I can control the weather).

I had a stay booked sinceFeb (it’sJune now)& my stay was planned for the nextweek when this happened.Airbnb took my first half of the deposit on the stay noproblem.2nd 1 was set up to automatically come out of my card, I had the correct numbers,&had used the same card on file for another stay!So it def was working &had funds on it!They emailed me that my card was declining payment and I did not see this notice.THEY HAVE MY OTHER CONTACT INFO SO THEY SHOULD HAVE CONTACTED ME ANOTHER WAY!They had no issues texting me for feedback on other tripsSo why couldn’t they call/text me? Eventhough my card was correct &on the app said connected.they still kept declining the payment & I even had another form of payment on it! Guesswhat that meant? Stay autocanceled. I call Airbnbat 2am when I saw on the app it was canceled. They tell me ask host if room is available still or ask for a refund.Well the policy host had was “nonrefundable”which is bs!! I asked host about availability&some1 already booked it with just 2 days of my stay canceled.I asked them any way for a refund asAirbnb told me to keep harassing the host for a refund- this is money that Airbnb really owes me. host said“can’t do it strict policy” I’m sorry but this is a condo you’re renting. Not a businessYou could have made an exception when I told you everything that was happening.I was told on the phone by Airbnbif the host replies to refund question- ss it & send to them- I said what if they decline?She said she would give a Airbnbcredit. I finallygot answer from host & called backAirbnb because our conversation ontext and call wasended at least4 times- I had been on with multiple people and calls, toldcustomerservice the other lady promised a credit if host declined refund- this lady told me thatnever happened there’s nothing she can do!I lost $800 plus for nothing.Noone is helping- host is greedy!Disgustingservice &business I willnever use this app again&I have been for years!",1

"Airbnb Left Me Injured, Stranded in the Rain, and Homeless — Then Lied Twice and Walked Away","Airbnb Left Me Injured, Stranded in the Rain, and Homeless — Then Lied Twice and Walked AwayI had been staying in an Airbnb in Vietnam for two weeks when I was involved in a serious motorbike accident. I suffered a broken foot, broken ribs, and open wounds. While I was at the hospital receiving treatment, the host removed the original mattress and replaced it with the exposed raw latex core from inside a mattress — no cover, no casing, just a slab of rubber.This wasn’t a mistake — it was a deliberate ploy to protect their mattress, clearly intended to avoid damage from my injuries. I was made to feel like a health hazard, not a guest. These latex cores emit formaldehyde, benzene, and other toxic VOCs, and are not safe for direct human contact. I became ill from the fumes and politely asked the host to replace it with a proper mattress again. They were visibly annoyed that I had noticed.Soon after, they began messaging me aggressively, demanding to see my full visa, despite already having photographed my passport and visa stamp as required by Vietnamese law. This was clearly an intimidation tactic. Eventually, a man came to my room, pressuring me to show my visa and suggesting the police would be called. I was on crutches, in pain, alone, and scared. I gave them my visa out of fear. It was now obvious they wanted me out.I contacted Airbnb. I provided full documentation, including photos and medical info. Airbnb support agreed the situation was unacceptable. They promised me a refund via coupon, so I could immediately rebook a new property. That’s the only reason I left — I trusted Airbnb’s word.But as soon as I left the property, Airbnb stonewalled me.I was left stranded on the street for 9 hours, during rainy season, with:•	Exposed wounds•	A broken foot and cracked ribs•	Crutches•	5 heavy bags of belongingsI had nowhere to go, and the promised coupon had not been added to my account. I messaged Airbnb repeatedly. No one responded. I was abandoned in a foreign country while seriously injured, soaking wet, humiliated, and completely unsupported. I had to borrow money just to get a hotel for the night — and that was only the beginning.Two days later, I got through to Airbnb again. They apologised, said the refund had now been initiated as cash instead of a coupon, and offered partial compensation for my hotel stay. They told me it would arrive in 5–15 working days.But then — they backtracked again. Within hours, I received another message saying Airbnb would not refund me or compensate me at all, falsely claiming I had “chosen” to leave the property. That directly contradicts their own written instructions.I am now six days into this nightmare, completely drained — physically, financially, and emotionally. I still have injuries. I’ve had to borrow money to survive, and I’m once again facing homelessness until payday — entirely because I believed Airbnb’s word and acted in good faith.Airbnb’s conduct has been:•	Cruel•	Deceptive•	Psychologically abusive•	And a complete violation of duty of careThey treated me like a problem to be removed, not a human being in need. They made promises, watched me act on them, and then cut me off the moment it was no longer convenient. They left me on the street in a medical crisis.I am pursuing legal and regulatory complaints through UK, EU, and Vietnamese channels. I have full documentation — screenshots, receipts, chat logs, photos — and I won’t stop until they are held accountable.If you’re injured, vulnerable, or traveling alone — do not trust Airbnb. When I needed help most, they didn’t just fail me. They abandoned me, misled me, and left me in the rain to fend for myself.Avoid Airbnb. Your safety means nothing to them.",1
Bad experience,Bad experience. Airbnb asked me several times to submit my case to get it reviewed by an internal team and few minutes later I got an automatic email that did not even reviewed my case. Talking to them on phone is not helpful as they are only concerened about hosts and notguests because hosts bring them more money. I can't trust Airbnb anymore and requested to delete my account.,1
This was my last booking with them.,"Not sure what's going on with Airbnb, but this is the last time I'm using them.Out of the last three bookings I made, two were canceled last minute. LAST MINUTE. Here's how Airbnb handled it:Sure, I understand that things can go wrong and cancellations can happen from time to time. But the real issue here is how Airbnb handles these situations.First of all, you can’t leave an honest review for an accommodation that cancels on you last minute. I want to warn others about my experience. Why is Airbnb protecting the host and not being TRANSPARENT? Where is the option to leave a review for a place that completely screwed me over?The money left my account, the transaction happened, so why am I not allowed to share my experience? This is a question for Airbnb.Second, they clearly do not care about your situation.The latest cancellation happened in a location where, unless you book in advance, you end up paying more than double the normal rate.So here I am, arriving with my 5-year-old daughter in front of the accommodation, only to be met with a ""Sorry for the inconvenience"" and a useless €30 credit for a new booking. I had to urgently find another place, pay double the price, and ended up being late for work.In this case, I expected Airbnb to at least cover the difference I had to pay. But of course, their policy doesn’t work that way. Their policy is to screw you over.Then at around 11 PM, one of their so-called ""expert"" support agents contacts me to suggest three listings I might consider and apologizes for the situation. Just beyond pathetic.I’ve used Airbnb for over 5 years.This was my last booking with them.I genuinely hope they go bankrupt soon.",1

No basic courtesy.Airbnb support kept repeating the cancellation policy and offered a small coupon, even though I lost nearly $2,000. I stayed polite and patient throughout, but there was no real help, no flexibility, and no accountability.What made it worse is that I was left dealing with all of this across time zones, stressing late at night just to get someone to help.

Whilst I appreciate that Airbnb may have had to cancel the booking / Host for their reasons to look after customers. They should have dine their due diligence in the first place.   They offered to help find another suitable accommodation, however as it was so late in the day, there was nothing in the price range and locality that matched what we had previously booked.   Obviously my family was unhappy.  I though that Airbnb may have gone out of their way to find a suitable accommodation at the same cost to me even if it cost them, as any decent travel company would do, and as I have experienced before with other travel companies.  BUT NO. THEY COULD NOT DO THIS.After much discussion with Ronald a senior case manager at Airbnb I was offered a figure of £73.77 both verbally and in writing on a number of occasions.I decided to take up this offer reluctantly, only to be told that he had made a mistake and that they could only offer $40.I have both a verbal and written agreement by a professional company 'Airbnb'.

Sometimes, the service fee alone can be a significant percentage of the total price, making the platform less affordable than it appears at first glance.What's more disappointing is that these fees aren't always transparent until the final stages of booking. It feels misleading, and I wish Airbnb would be more upfront about the total cost from the beginning.

Great job keeping guests safe!I didnt see any signs of actions taken to remove those duplicate housing offers, but at least taking case up before my trip started, attaching all screenshots and host not responding within 48 hours, the case was resolved in my favor.",4
I just saw a review on this website,"I just saw a review on this website: "" honestly I don’t know how they got so big with such terrible customer service""------ Can't agree more    It's my first time using airbnb in EU and I can't find where the apartment, Calling the online service and they reply me nothing!! the mobil signal is very weak and it took me about 3 hours then I finally find it.",1
Such a big corporation like Airbnb…,"Such a big corporation like Airbnb should have a proper system to vet property listings on their website. They are plenty of people providing false information about their properties just to attract bookings. I booked an accommodation in Bali in May 2025. When we checked in, we realized that the host has given fraudulent information about the property, such as distance to the beach and Mall, amenities etc. The host was lying about everything. We had to leave the property and requested for refund to Airbnb, but got no reply after several attempts. All I got was auto reply. I've been a customer of Airbnb for many years, but have now decided to boycott this company in future. There is simply no customer service.",1
Account blocked without explanation — left stranded and unsupported abroad,"I am a Ukrainian citizen who has been living in different countries due to the war, including Canada and Ukraine. I had relied on Airbnb for several years without any issues — I even received humanitarian housing support from them in 2022.Recently, my account was suddenly deactivated without any clear explanation after I tried to book a short stay using a Ukrainian bank card that I had used before. I had verified my identity, provided my Ukrainian passport, Canadian address, and submitted two valid bank cards under my name.After the deactivation, I was left without accommodation abroad, unable to contact my host or manage my existing bookings. Airbnb only sent vague, automated responses and refused to explain what rule I had supposedly broken.I wrote a detailed and respectful letter asking for a proper review, but received another copy-paste message saying my account would stay deactivated — permanently.This caused significant emotional stress and travel disruption. It made me feel completely unsafe and unsupported in a vulnerable situation. I feel like I’ve been unfairly targeted simply for using two valid cards or for moving between countries.Airbnb claims to support displaced people, but this experience made me feel the opposite — ignored, flagged, and excluded by a system that offers no humanity or transparency.",1
Policy and Hosting,"I spent May 1-31 2025 at an AirBnb in Rome hosted by Alessia and her mother 109 via di Torrevecchia. There were 6 people using 1 shower.

"Title Serious complaint ignored, host allowed to retaliate publicly","Title: Airbnb failed to protect me as a guest – retaliatory review ignoredI had a terrible experience as a guest when I stayed briefly in Rionegro, Colombia. I was trapped inside a host’s apartment due to lack of check-in instructions, and there was mold in the bathroom, no toilet paper, and poor sanitation. I reported these issues to Airbnb with videos and photos and received partial compensation.But after the host was notified of my complaint, she falsely accused me of stealing a remote control and posted a negative review full of personal attacks, dismissing my experience. Despite my final appeal and strong evidence of retaliation, Airbnb refused to remove the review.I am a respectful guest with a clean record who only stayed a few hours during a layover. This review has damaged my reputation and Airbnb closed the case without proper protection. I followed every policy, yet the platform failed to uphold its own standards.Guests deserve safety and fairness—especially when reporting serious problems. Airbnb’s system allowed a false, retaliatory review to stay on my profile. Very disappointing and unfair.",1
Airbnb Is Protecting Fraudulent Hosts and Exploiting Guests — Unethical & Infuriating,"I’m absolutely disgusted and angry with how Airbnb has handled my recent experience. I booked a stay where the host locked me out in the heat, failed to provide a working key, and repeatedly invaded my privacy by constantly coming outside and watching me — making me feel harassed and racially profiled.Out of courtesy and empathy (because they had children), I chose not to file a complaint at the time. Huge mistake.After I checked out, the host falsely accused me of smoking marijuana inside the home (not true), left a retaliatory and defamatory review on my profile, and filed a fraudulent damage claim against me for a so-called “smoke odor” and cleaning costs — which are, in reality, the host’s responsibility between guests.Airbnb’s response? They demanded $211 for “cleaning,” refused to show me any real evidence, cited “confidentiality,” and pressured me to pay within 24 hours, threatening my account. They ignored everything I provided about the host’s misconduct, refused to remove the false review, and dismissed my concerns entirely.This company sides with lying hosts to avoid using their insurance and makes guests pay for costs they should never be responsible for. When I requested fairness, they offered to reduce the charge if I paid quickly — essentially a shakedown.To make things worse, when I asked for proof of damages, receipts, or inspection records, Airbnb repeatedly refused. I even told them the host’s husband kicked in the door to let us in after we were locked out, yet that somehow didn’t matter.Let’s be real: Airbnb has created a system where guests are vulnerable, blamed, and exploited, while dishonest hosts are protected and rewarded. I have no trust left in this platform. It’s unethical, manipulative, and fraudulent.Shame on Airbnb.",1
The fees are horrendous and they allow…,The fees are horrendous and they allow false reviews and don’t bother to look into them. Idk why anyone bothers to use them. I feel like it’s hard to trust both the owners or Airbnb,1
Airbnb is not the same anymore,I honestly don’t know how they got so big with such terrible customer service.I booked a stay with 5 months in advance - cancellation policy of up to 48h after booking for full refund or partial refund after this.The host cancelled the stay 3 weeks before arrival - and listed the accommodation again for the same dates and prices. I paid 565 euros and when I searched for similar accommodations the prices were at least 1K euros. The solution from Airbnb? 20 euros voucher and not even a sorry for the bad experience. What am I supposed to do? This company is a joke.,1
Customer service is hopeless …,We host 3 properties and are trying update the notifications phone number. This appears to be totally impossible. No matter how many times I speak to people they don’t seem to be able to help. So who can help?,1
Airbnb enabling false reviews & ignoring data rights,"I was reviewed by a host for a stay that never happened. The reservation was cancelled, I never checked in, and yet Airbnb is allowing the host to submit a public review about me.I raised this immediately and was met with vague, scripted replies. No one took accountability. I objected in writing under GDPR Article 21, citing that the upcoming review is inaccurate and reputationally harmful (Art. 5 & 6), and they still refused to block it.I have now filed a formal complaint with the Irish Data Protection Commission.This is not a refund issue — it’s a serious data protection failure and violation of guest trust. If you’re considering using Airbnb, be warned: your personal information and public reputation are not safe with them.⸻",1
Reviews are removed,"I used to live Airbnb, but they have lost my trust. After a recent nightmare situation where I was scammed by a host I found out that Airbnb had removed my review allowing the host to continue scamming others. The support team I spoke with was completely useless. You cannot trust reviews on Airbnb. They remove anything unfavorable to artificially inflate listings. Do yourself a favor and book elsewhere!",1
So disappointing,"I am so upset by my recent experience with air b n b. Ive been a customer for years and i travel regulary for work and leisure. I went to Turkey and had such a terrible experience with a host. The place was full of mould, the balcony doors didnt lock ad most importantly for me I had specifically asked for the wifi speed to be 100mbps because of the work I needed to do. It was even verified in an internal message we had together on air b n b. Due to the situation I had to cancel the booking and find somewhere else. I was advised to contact the host first, which I did and as it was the evening I did not expect her to resolve it until the morning. I stated this in a text message and showcased it to air b n b. The host agreed to a refund in the morning and I left to another place. I then get the most awful review on my air b n b profile that includes completely false information about me and the experience. The host accused me of not paying (which is impossible because you cannot book a place without paying) , tht I got angry with her in the night because she didnt reply, which was also not the case as we had amicable messages and as Id already explained I didn't expect her to respond until the morning. I contacted Air b n b to get the review rebuked because it goes against policy to have false information in a review. They rejected my three attempts of filling in the form for this and also the customer service team basically said they cannot do anything even though they agreed that the information was false and its not helpful to me to have this awful and false review on my profile. If you have a policy, the policy should be abided to and you should care about your paying customers reputation in the matter. Who wants a review that is completely false and abusive on their profile?",1

Review of AirB&B,"Review of AirB&B: A Deep Disappointment After Years of LoyaltyI had been a long-time and loyal user of AirB&B. With over 20 trips around the world under my belt, the service had always left a positive impression. Not only did I use it myself, but I also recommended it to friends, acquaintances, and in my blog with over 3,000 subscribers. I trusted AirB&B because I believed that even in a difficult situation, they would have my back. And in the past, they did — during trips to Venice and the US, when accommodations turned out to be uninhabitable, the AirB&B team always found a solution quickly and covered the cost difference for new accommodation.However, my experience in Paris in May 2025 was a real shock and disappointment.I planned to celebrate my birthday on May 28 in Paris with my mom and friends. Two months in advance, I had booked what I thought was a great place. But on the day of check-in, everything went wrong. The host didn’t respond to my messages or calls. I was only able to reach him through AirB&B’s support team. When we finally entered the apartment, we were horrified: it was dirty, there were holes in the walls and furniture, vomit stains on the floor, and no clean bedding. The host offered us used sheets with visible hair on them, insisting they were “fresh.” The apartment was booked for three people, but for the third guest, all he provided was a thin blanket — no pillow, no proper bedding.Wires were hanging out of the walls, and the bathroom was in a disgusting condition.I contacted AirB&B support and sent photos, explaining everything in detail. And what did I get in return? A voucher for 20% off my next booking. No real help. I was told to find a new place on my own, pay for it out of pocket, and wait up to five days for a refund of the ruined booking. The problem was — I didn’t have enough money available to do that, especially in one of Europe’s most expensive cities. After several calls with support, the only thing they could offer was a voucher worth 50% of the original booking. That was it. I was left standing in the street with my mom and our luggage on my birthday.Luckily, I managed to find a last-minute alternative — it was twice as expensive, but at least it was clean and functional. Out of ten hosts I contacted, only one responded. I nearly ended up spending the night outside, with my mom, in Paris, on my birthday.So what’s the takeaway? I am extremely disappointed. While the support agents were polite and sympathetic, they were completely powerless and unable to help. The quality of service from AirB&B has significantly declined. They no longer offer the safety and support that used to set them apart. I will no longer use this service, and I absolutely won’t recommend it to others. Fortunately, there are now many other platforms to find accommodation.I hope my experience helps other travelers avoid this kind of situation, save their nerves and money, and not end up stranded in a foreign city on a special day.",1
PRICE YOU SEE IS NOT WHAT YOU PAY,"While searching for a place to stay a pop-up showed on the screen stating the price you see ($640 for the one I booked) is the price you pay. NOPE!! I was intimately charged $778.35. Contacted host, she couldn’t help. Called AIRBNB and couldn’t even get anyone on the phone or thru chat. Never again!!!!!!",1
French bookings are a nightmare,"I am normally very happy to book with Airbnb, but booking French properties is an absolute nighmare. You need to wait for confirmation of the booking, and in my experience 80 per cent of the properties are not available for booking, yet they are listed for the dates you look for. They take payment and then you have to wait around a week for the refund. I am currently looking for a property in the Alps, and 5 properties have rejected my request for different reasons, mostly because they have not updated their prices for the next ski season, but they haven't bothered to remove the listings. What a waste of time. Airbnb should not allow this, it makes it very frustrating and time consuming to look for accommodation, in fact I given up, I will look elswhere,",2
Terrible customer serivce! Practically useless!,"Wow, Amazed to see a company so well-known that has 1-star reviews, but I agree. I have had so many glitches on the website as a host. The last one was that a host would see a different price, like a third of my price, than on my hosting site. I even screenshared this unexplainable situation,  but no one took responsibility. I lost many bookings. Then you spend hours with supervisors with no authority to do anything, who sit in the Philippines and cannot solve any problem as they are not authorised to. No compensation, no explanation why this happened. Then, often my calendar is blocked without me having touched it. I heard many times how sorry they are, and that is it. I feel Airbnb is on decline, and as many countries now will ban it the business model is failing. Making billions on the back of frustrated customers is not going to be viable!",1
Airbnb ignores its own policies and offers no real support for hosts,"I’m an Airbnb host who received a retaliatory, bad-faith review after I declined a guest’s request to extend their stay. The review focused heavily on lighting and blinds (over 50% of the content), gave 3 stars for location, check-in, and value — despite no complaints during the stay and the use of Airbnb’s automated smart lock system in a central Austin location.I submitted proof including screenshots and listing photos. Airbnb denied the removal request without explanation and told me there was no way to contact the Reviews Team — then redirected me to a feedback form. As a disabled veteran small business owner, this hurts both financially and reputationally.Airbnb claims to protect hosts from irrelevant and retaliatory reviews but refuses to enforce its own Review Policy when it matters.",1

Airbnb Charges You Before Payment Is Due – Breaching UK Consumer Law,"I was shocked to find Airbnb charging my card for upcoming bookings a full week before payment was actually due — even though the hosts’ policies clearly allow free cancellation up to 24 hours before check-in.This isn’t just poor practice — it’s deceptive, coercive, and potentially unlawful under UK consumer protection law. Specifically, the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013 prohibit charging for services before a legal obligation exists. Airbnb’s “charge now, refund later” approach ignores your cancellation rights and shifts the financial risk onto you.Moreover, the card Airbnb used for the charge was only used once for a reservation fee and was never designated as a stored or default payment method on my Airbnb account. My Airbnb profile explicitly lists a different card as the authorised and stored payment method. Yet Airbnb used a card I used for a one-off payment without my consent.When I raised the above issues, Airbnb kept using arguments irrelevant to my complaints (e.g. but you're eligible for a refund anyway) and completely ignored the not authorised card issue.Airbnb clearly knows better. For a company this size to flout basic consumer protections is unacceptable. I’ve filed a complaint with the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and urge others facing similar practices to do the same.I expected more from a platform that claims to empower guests. Instead, I got a forced transaction based on terms that hadn’t even taken effect yet.Be warned: Airbnb may charge you before your booking  is even due and use payment methods you never consented to — and against their own stated rules.",1

They don't protect their customers,"An host asked for 1000€ of refund for a damage I didn't do. It's about a sofa bed which I didn't even open and the only person sleeping on the couch was a 10 year old girl. They claimed there was a damage to the infrastructure. This is just impossible. Airbnb didn't even consider anything and just asked to me a reimbursement. We'll see in court because I didn't even touch the sofa and I want to see how they can prove I broke it. By the way, this host even gave me 5 star review because I left the flat completely immaculate, actually better than how we found it. This host has a dozen of apartments all around Paris and they are making millions and keep proposing discounts for giving them 5 star reviews.",1

Did not return any money or move her to a safer location, Airbnb is a JOKE!!! Not only this, but there was severe dirt and even rat droppings around this airbnb that she discovered and again, AIRBNB did nothing! The craziest part is that my daughter was shocked and did not leave a review since AIRBNB didn't care and then the owner of the property left a BAD review on my daughter because she had tried to resolve these very big issues. Airbnb are criminals. Use VRBO from now on!",1

I worked hard to build a five-star listing, and now I’m being told my only option is to delete the entire listing and start over, losing all my reviews.It’s unfair that hosts don’t have more control over how we’re presented on a platform we help build.

This phone is 10 years old and not in use, there is no way for me to get this from my phone provider.This means that guests can not reach me.I can not add my bank details to my account to actually receive any pay outs from my rentals.I have been in contact with Airbnb support several times and offered passport verification,bank verification,dob,proof of adress in order to change the phone number.After speaking in the phone in several occasions the response is that if i cant get the phone provider to activate this number then the money will stay with AirBNB.They say that i should add a family member as a co-host and get the money to my family members account for future bookings.

"Airbnb’s Review System Encourages Pressure, Not Honesty","As a frequent Airbnb user, I’ve noticed a troubling trend: many hosts now push hard for 5-star reviews - sometimes through messages, signs in the home, or follow-up pressure after your stay. It’s clear this is driven by Airbnb’s algorithm, which seems to only value perfect ratings.This creates a fake sense of quality. Some listings are overrated because guests feel uncomfortable giving anything less than 5 stars, even when the stay was average. I’ve even experienced hosts offering small gifts or guilt-tripping messages to “earn” that perfect score.Airbnb should consider a fairer system, like a Net Promoter Score (NPS), where guests anonymously share whether they’d recommend a place. This would promote real feedback and better experiences for everyone.Until then, take glowing reviews with a grain of salt, many are more about keeping the peace than telling the truth.",2

I reached back out to Airbnb and told them I didn’t think it was fair and they said the host was firm in me not getting any money back so I reached back out to her and she said it wasn’t her but was Airbnb that wouldn’t let me get my money back.

Poor slow communication,"Poor slow communication. Even in the face of irrefutable evidence they will stick with the same rehearsed lines.E.g I’d set up a new listing for my space, not realising my old property management company that I’d decided to move on from hadn’t taken their version down. Despite showing them the trail of correspondence, my proof of address and property ownership they decided I was the fraud and suspended me for two weeks. Costing me significant bookings at peak holiday. Only unblocked me after the company delisted the old listingLatest issue was after turning on instant booking I had a reservation six months out come in. It was a weekend I hadn’t realised had become unblocked - as soon as I realised I spoke to the guest. But Airbnb requires the host to cancel in this situation - and this is quite costly both financially and in terms of superhost. I have an average 4.95 rating and have never cancelled. And of course I would have honoured the guest if the booking was within two to three months. But six months is ample to find an alternative space. Airbnb charges me $85 which is a quarter of the payout I’d have received. I also lose superhost status as they only allow cancellation rate of 1 per cent. Which as a new space and only 20 bookings in six months - will take me YEARS to regain.Guest doesn’t get the fee as compensation. Airbnb does!Also just seems unfair when they actively encourage you to have flexible cancellation policies for guests.And while I understand it can’t be the same flexibility for hosts - I think there should be some scope for cancellations beyond a reasonable time frame.Tried to contact Airbnb got not response.Same thing happened when I tried messaging them once with a genuine security concern of a guest turning up - who was messaging me from a profile that was not the same on the booking. Got zero response",1
Extremely Disappointed with My Recent Experience,"I am writing to express my profound dissatisfaction with the recent experience I had on your platform, which has been nothing short of frustrating and disappointing.This situation began with the host I booked accusing us of causing damages to their property—an accusation we were only informed about after we had checked out. The photos provided as evidence are questionable and inconsistent, yet we are being asked to pay for these alleged damages.I took the appropriate steps by raising a case, only to discover later that it was closed without our knowledge because Airbnb had already settled it. To make matters worse, the host left a negative review on my profile, and your customer service team has done nothing to address this or to remove the unjust review.This entire experience has left me feeling that your platform is far from customer-centric. The lack of support and resolution in this matter is unacceptable, and I am left with a very bad impression of your service.",1

"After 12 years and 68 trips, Airbnb left me unprotected","I’ve been a loyal Airbnb guest for over 10 years, with 90 completed trips and 68 positive reviews. Until now, I’ve had nothing but great experiences — but this latest incident has completely destroyed my trust in the platform.During a recent stay in Normandy, France, the host left a false and hostile review, accusing us of “refusing to pay,” claiming “food on walls,” and even mentioning “blood” and “worms” — none of which are visible in the photos she provided. In reality:•	I proactively offered to pay in person•	I reiterated the offer via message•	I paid the full €50 she requested through Airbnb — even though Airbnb later told me I wasn’t required to pay at allThe tone of the host’s messages after checkout was friendly, even thanking us — until we questioned vague extra charges. Only then did her language become erratic and personal. The retaliatory review was posted after I disengaged from the accusations.Airbnb refused to remove the review, despite their own policies against retaliation and false claims. I escalated through customer support, emailed legal, and used their official review dispute tool — all to no effect.To be called “a nightmare” after 10 years of positive history, during a time when we were between homes with two small children, is incredibly hurtful — and the fact that Airbnb sided with the host anyway shows where their priorities lie.I will no longer be using Airbnb.

This company should be banned! First they were forced to move me one month ago, when I rented a place that has nothing to do with the beautiful pictures. It was a war and they just made the decision when I was in danger. Gave them one more chance, and guess what?

They lied about how many people stayed. That should’ve been enough to question everything else—but Airbnb gave their version more weight than mine. I brought up the facts. I followed the process. Still, they left the review up.It felt like I was left out to dry. All that hard work, all the consistency, and the reputation I’d built—swept aside in favor of someone who didn’t play by the rules from the start.This changed how I see the platform. Hosting through Airbnb has always been about trust, but now I’m not sure that trust goes both ways. If you’re a host, know this: no matter how solid your track record is, it can take just one dishonest guest to flip everything—and Airbnb might not be there for you when it happens.",1
Gift card,"I tried to book a gift card as a wedding present. The transaction was declined even though I tried multiple cards. I called the help centre and the person I spoke to was lovely, but said that the gift card could only be bought for yourself and the credit applied to your own account, it couldn't be transferred to another person, how is that a gift card??",1
Worst platform ever!,"Worst platform ever, disrespectful, irresponsible and without the slightest empathy or consideration for its users! I have always been a respectful guest, with good reviews, I have never broken a single rule! I had rented a house for my vacation in Mykonos 3 months in advance through the platform and it was already paid for, my trip was all set with accommodation and tickets paid for. Until Airbnb decided to ruin my vacation, they simply canceled my reservation and deleted my account for no reason, no explanation, causing me to lose my reservation and now with little time left for the trip I can't rent another place that fits my budget and is of the same standard, which could cause me to postpone or cancel the trip! Thank you for ruining my Airbnb vacation, you are a trash company!",1
Not giving a s*** about loyal customers,"In many countries the price to quality ratio is better that on other platforms.Their customer support is horrible though. They had an error in one of the booking, and instead of providing another accomodation quickly they made me wait. I missed an expensive tour non-refundable and I had to book another accomodation last minute which was very expensive because of them. I'd expect them to value their loyal customers more.I've been using it for more than 6 years and made a lot of bookings lately. But this stops today. I'd rather use booking.com.",2
Airbnb canceled our reservation at 1:00…,"Airbnb canceled our reservation at 1:00 AM — not the host — leaving my family, including my elderly father with serious medical conditions, stranded in the middle of the night with no shelter, restrooms, or assistance. Airbnb provided no alternative accommodations and told us to find a hotel ourselves. We incurred unplanned hotel costs and endured serious emotional and physical hardship, especially for my father. Despite this being a direct failure by Airbnb (not a host cancellation), they offered only $125 — just 20% of the reservation cost. I’m demanding full reimbursement, appropriate compensation, and a formal apology for this unacceptable breach of duty and care.",1

⭐ 1-Star Review for Airbnb:,"⭐ 1-Star Review for Airbnb:Review:A guest booked for 5 people, but turned-up with 11, held a house and pool party, and filmed a video shoot all of which violated our listed our house rules. We asked her to pay for the extra six guests, and in response, she left a 1-star retaliatory review.We submitted video evidence to Airbnb showing the violations, but they refused to remove the review. Also while writing our response, Airbnb’s system logged us out and posted an unfinished reply, which now damages our listing further.Despite escalating the issue, Airbnb’s staff and senior case managers defended the guest, ignored their own policies, and showed no understanding of customer service or business impact. As a result, we received no bookings since then. Airbnb has wholly failed to support us as hosts. I am so shocked that as a public limited company they hired staff that cannot even think out of the box. I will be taking legal proceeding against airbnb.",1
Frustrating and Unhelpful Customer Support Experience,"Airbnb’s customer support feels slow, inconsistent, and heavily scripted. It often seems like agents are limited in what they can actually do, and issues get passed around without real resolution. There’s little sense of accountability or urgency, and it’s hard to feel genuinely supported as a guest. Communication needs to be clearer, more human, and more action-driven.",1

They offer convenience.,"My family and I have used AirBNB for our vacations a few times and we have never had any problems. It's convenient because we usually travel in groups and with a house, everyone can stay together comfortably. This enables us to enjoy activities together and save money on food by cooking some of our own meals.The only thing I don't like is that as a secondary guest, I can't leave my own review on their site. Only the person who made the reservation can do that and it bites. Every adult guest should be able to share their own experience.",5

Airbnbs business model favors dishonest hosts.,"Airbnb favors hosts who try to maximize their profit by scamming the system  they claim false damage charges,charging extra to have cleaning that’s supposed to be a part of the contract, or they provide some cleaning supplies for you to clean it yourThe hosts want to communicate with you off of the platform so they can sell you anything from their rental without the platform fees, to products they or their family sellsIf you complain you probably will get blocked from using the platform being labeled high riskThey need hosts and they favor them over paying guestsThey do not even favor guests who have used their platform repeatedly .",2
After upates unuseful platform!,Since airbnb updated their system I am unable to make a reservation. After several [ months] contacts with their customer service which has not resolved the issue i have declared airbnb unuseful and is not my preferred platform to book. I use succesfully other webs and do not recommend airbnb,1
Poor Customer Service/doesn't properly represent properties,"We booked a house that AirBnB represented to be just off the beach on the same side of the street and outside of town.  When we received the actual address of the house it's on the other side of the street so you have to cross the main road to ""walk"" to the beach and it's in the middle of the town behind a hotel and brewery.  It's not anywhere close to the location that was represented.  Of course by the time we were given the actual address it was less than a week before our trip and past the cancellation date.  We asked the host about the address and she told us that Airbnb does not have the location correct and that she has asked them to correct it.  There is no mention in the posting that the address is incorrect.  We contacted AirBnB customer support and were told that  they don't show the actual address and since it's less than a mile from where they showed it to be they would not less us cancel the booking.  We picked this house and paid an extra $800 based on the location.  Being next to the beach and being almost a mile away is a huge difference and is not a proper representation of the locations.  Don't ever use AirBnB.  Go to VRBO or another site.",1
Today,"Today, I missed a confirmed apartment booking in Sharm El Sheikh due to the lack of timely support and attention from your team. I tried to resolve the issue through your platform but received no meaningful response, which resulted in me losing both my reservation and valuable time.This is completely unacceptable.I relied on Airbnb’s credibility and service quality, but what I experienced today was nothing short of negligence. No one was available to help, and no action was taken to ensure I could access the property or find an immediate alternative.I am honestly very angry. This kind of experience not only ruined my day but also made me question whether Airbnb is truly reliable when travelers need it most.",1
Airbnb favors hosts,"Airbnb favors hostsBooked three days stay in Orlando, as soon as we arrived, we were on the mission to kill cockroaches, and a flying moth also visit us. we contacted host and she refused to refund for the extra two days. we moved the next day and contacted airbnb for resolution.

"Title: Airbnb Penalised Me £2,750 for a Guest Who Missed Her Flight – Now Holding Me Liable","I’m a host and Airbnb applied a £2,750.71 negative balance to my account — for a situation that wasn’t my fault.My guest missed her flight and couldn’t arrive on the agreed check-in date. I offered to help with new dates or cancellation to make things easier. I genuinely thought Airbnb would handle the refund through their guest protection — not take the money from me.What happened next shocked me:•	Airbnb processed the cancellation and paid me.•	Later, they also refunded the guest.•	Then they applied a negative balance to my account, as if I now owe them £2,750.I never knowingly agreed to this. There was no warning, no consent, and no explanation that I’d be personally liable if Airbnb made payout mistakes. I simply tried to be flexible.Now I can’t host again unless I repay the full amount — for a guest who didn’t show up.This is:•	Host exploitation•	Misuse of refund systems•	A breach of transparency and fairnessI’ve filed a GDPR Subject Access Request and will escalate this to the UK ICO and Competition & Markets Authority. Airbnb has refused to resolve this through support. This is how they treat hosts trying to help guests in good faith.",1
If I could give zero stars I would,"If I could give zero stars I would. Overall my experience with Air BNB properties has been awful, including this last one (Oak Knoll Cottage in Prescott, AZ). I have stayed at over 2 dozen properties the last 6 years and have been burned by Air BNB and hosts one too many times. Only 2 properties have been good during that time. Most have been disgustingly dirty, not as advertised in some important way, or the host ends up sticking us with extra fees that we didn't incur (such as damage or stains caused by prior occupants). Air BNB always takes the side of the owner on those. One owner even had hidden ""security"" cameras INSIDE the unit to watch occupants while they were there. Yes, INSIDE. Please beware of this company and its hosts. At the very least you run the risk of dirty properties or getting stuck with fees that are not yours to pay. I'm disabling my account and going back to staying in hotels I trust and can easily research ahead of time.",1

Masters of deceit and manipulation,"Air BnB have truly mastered the art of maximising profits at the expense of all guests. Whilst continuing to protect hosts, because the more active hosts the more they profit.After 10 years of use, a few bad experiences resulting in weeks of back and forth with the most appalling customer service I have ever experienced. (Worse than HMRC, which I never thought was possible). My time has come to abandon this company and warn others. It works well, until it doesn’t. Then you are completely left alone and abused whilst they suck the time and energy to the point where you simply have no choice but to give up.Worst of all, they won’t publish your reviews. If negative, so that hosts are protected and they continue to profit. One of the most manipulative companies that exist today. True masters in the dark side of abusing the consumers wallet & time.",1

For the host to then attempt to convince us to cancel as they had over booked. Airbnb have fined the host but now we have been left with no place to stay that meets the requirements without us having to pay hundreds more. Apparently we should be 'satisfied' that we have been given a refund for the money we paid for the airbnb, that us having to pay extra or we waste money on flights is fine.",1
I need to wait 15 days for a refund…,I need to wait 15 days for a refund from AirBnb when the host canceled the booking only because they forgot to delist the property for this summer.

Great for long term stays,"I used Airbnb years ago for long term stays then stopped as had a few bad experiences (host not Airbnb).Started using them again and out of four properties 3 were amazing,  one was not.I think as long as you check reviews,  Airbnb offers some great deals but you have to do your homework.",5

We haven't gotten any help or advise on how to proceed nor have we gotten a call back in more than 6hours even though we insistsled that it's urgent. Now we spent all evening and day to argue with a very offensive host. Also we don't want to go through the hassle of packing,finding an accommodation and travelling somewhere else because of this issue.Hosts like that shouldn't be allowed to host and Airbnb should offer some proper customer service.

If I could give zero stars,"If I could give zero stars, I would. Upon arrival at this so-called property with ""historic charm,"" we immediately noticed a hole in the closet floor. The kitchen cabinets were in terrible shape, and the bathroom had no exhaust fan. I reported these issues to both the host and Airbnb, only to receive dismissive and unhelpful responses from both. Labeling a rundown place as ""historic charm"" is a deceptive way to mislead guests. This feels like a coordinated scam, and Airbnb appears complicit by allowing these listings to stay up. Travelers, beware.",1

I formally requested a review, but Airbnb closed the case without addressing these facts.I’m now escalating this publicly. I expected better from a company that claims to support fairness and trust.#Airbnb #ConsumerRights #UnjustEnrichment #FairBooking",1
SCAM charges!! Don't use this company.,I got a random $270+ charge on my card from Airbnb. Havent used them since 2024. I called to have it refunded and ask what it was for.They wont tell me and will not refund saying it was probably a friend or family that used it.Im so beyond disbelief. These are scam like responses they clearly put a random charge on my card and saying someone else did it. I've never been so cheated by a company!,1
Airbnb Ignored Clear Policy Violations – Harmful Review Left Up,"I’ve been a loyal Airbnb host and have always tried to maintain a high standard for my guests. But I recently faced a deeply frustrating experience that I believe every host should be aware of.A guest left a review that included false and damaging claims, including:•	Speculation about hidden surveillance devices (with no evidence)•	A false statement that my listing was an “entire home” when it’s clearly listed as a guesthouse•	No issues raised during the stay — only false allegations made after checkoutI submitted two formal requests for removal, clearly referencing Airbnb’s own Review and Content Policies (which prohibit false or misleading content and unsubstantiated accusations). Both times, I received what felt like automated responses with no real explanation.Eventually, I was told the case was closed and the decision couldn’t be overturned — despite the review clearly violating the rules. This has had a real impact on my family’s small business, and I no longer feel protected as a host.Airbnb encourages hosts to be transparent and professional — but when the system fails to enforce its own policies, that trust breaks down. I hope Airbnb re-evaluates how it supports its host community in situations like this.",2
"Waste of time, research and then when request to book the owner refuses request 😡😡😡",If a property is advertised with dates you are able to book then what a waste of time that they can refuse the booking!!

"Misleading Listing, No Refund, Zero Accountability","I booked a property on Airbnb that advertised a jacuzzi and cowboy hot tub. The listing showed a filled, working tub in the photos, appeared in “hot tub” filtered search, and said “Enjoy the jacuzzi” early in the description. Both features were listed as included amenities.After booking, I discovered the jacuzzi was completely out of service, and the cowboy tub required an additional $60 fee — only mentioned at the bottom of the listing. This was not disclosed clearly or upfront.When I tried to cancel, Airbnb only offered cancellation with no refund. I contacted the host less than 20 minutes after booking — they refused to cancel. Airbnb support agents also denied a refund, despite the obvious misrepresentation and their own policy about listing accuracy.I formally informed both the host and Airbnb that I would not be checking in and have since filed complaints with multiple consumer protection agencies. I’ll be disputing the charge through my credit card.Airbnb does not take responsibility when hosts mislead guests, and their support is unwilling to resolve even clear, documented cases.

Misleading cancellation policy which costed me €920,"I've been using Airbnb for years and have always had great experiences—until my most recent booking.The issue was with the cancellation policy. The listing clearly stated that I could cancel by a certain time and receive a full refund. I followed that instruction and canceled within the timeframe—or so I thought. To my surprise, I later discovered that my booking was canceled but not eligible for a refund. It turns out the cancellation deadline was based on Thai time, while I was in Portugal. This crucial detail wasn’t made clear during the booking or cancellation process.As a result, I lost €920.I reached out to both the host and Airbnb support. While they expressed understanding and sympathy, no one offered any practical solution to help recover even part of the loss. No refund, no way to reverse the cancellation, no compensation—nothing.I'm very disappointed with Airbnb’s cancellation policies and the lack of a clear, reliable process to handle situations like this—especially when they result from misleading or incomplete information. Losing €920 due to a time zone mismatch and getting no support or alternative is incredibly frustrating.",1
A Nightmare Experience with Airbnb – Broken Promises and Abysmal Support,"My recent experience with Airbnb has been nothing short of a nightmare, marked by unprofessional hosts, deceptive practices, and a complete lack of accountability from Airbnb’s support team. What was supposed to be a family holiday in London turned into a stressful ordeal that left us stranded, humiliated, and financially burdened.Check-In Chaos and Misleading ListingsUpon arriving at our booked property in Canary Wharf, we waited outside for an hour with heavy luggage. The host’s representative, Vanessa, arrived late, forgot the keys, and later provided malfunctioning access to the building. When we finally entered, we discovered ongoing maintenance work—tools, workers’ belongings, and debris littered the living area and kitchen. This critical detail was never disclosed in the listing, despite the host’s later contradictory claims. When confronted, the host, Rossorio, became hostile, accused us of rudeness, and demanded we leave immediately.Airbnb’s “Support” – Empty Promises and GaslightingDesperate for help, I contacted Airbnb support multiple times. While agents initially promised compensation (verbally agreeing to £75 for expenses and a partial refund), these commitments vanished in writing. Instead, I received generic responses citing “host policies” and a refusal to honor verbal assurances. Worse, when I tried rebooking, Airbnb flagged me as an “unauthorized party,” blocking new reservations without explanation.Financial Loss and BetrayalDespite agreeing to a £35 cancellation fee for an upcoming reservation, Airbnb deducted £65 without justification. The promised £75 compensation for our ordeal also never materialized. In total, I’m out £105 due to Airbnb’s mismanagement. Their final response? A cold, copy-pasted link to cancellation policies and a dismissive “case closed” message.A Pattern of NegligenceEach support agent contradicted the last, forcing me to relive the trauma repeatedly. Commitments made over calls were denied in writing, exposing a systemic disregard for customer trust. Meanwhile, hosts like Rossorio face no consequences for blatant dishonesty, while guests bear the brunt of Airbnb’s lax oversight.Final Advice: Avoid AirbnbAfter this ordeal, I booked a hotel via Booking.com effortlessly. Airbnb, however, left my family stranded, stressed, and out of pocket. Their platform prioritizes hosts over guests, and their support team specializes in empty apologies, not solutions.Proceed with caution – unless you enjoy false promises, financial disputes, and hours wasted arguing with unresponsive “support.” Airbnb has lost a customer for life.",1

Hosts Beware,"Hosts, take note: Airbnb primarily views guests as their customers, not hosts. In many disputes, they tend to favor the traveler’s side—even when it comes to property damage or violations of house rules. Getting reimbursed for damages can be a frustrating, uphill process. Airbnb often issues partial refunds without your consent, and sometimes even full refunds within cancellation windows—regardless of circumstances. While the platform does a great job of getting your listing seen and booked, don’t expect a fair resolution when conflicts arise. As for retaliatory reviews? Unfortunately, contesting them is nearly always a losing battle.",2
Airbnb cancelled our booking a few days…,Airbnb cancelled our booking a few days before our trip. This flat has been booked 4 months ago. It's now impossible to find a flat in the same area for the same price. Never going to use it again. Very disappointing.,1
Disappointed: no support after same-day cancellation,"I've been a loyal Airbnb user for years and have always had great experiences — until now.I booked a stay and had to cancel just 3 hours later. The check-in was still days away, no services were used. Despite this, the host refused a full refund and Airbnb simply said there was “nothing they could do.”The platform hides behind policy and offers no protection to guests when a host chooses to be inflexible — even in clear, reasonable situations. I asked for a gesture of goodwill (like a credit), but even that was denied.Unfortunately, this experience has shown me that as a guest, you're on your own when things go wrong. I've lost trust in Airbnb and won’t be booking through them again.",1

Customer Service and Poor Website Redesign,"While Airbnb is a massive global platform, the quality of its customer service is surprisingly poor. It’s frustrating to see that a company valued at $84 billion has such a low average rating of 1.4 on Trustpilot—clearly, I’m not the only one who feels this way. The lack of responsive and helpful support is simply unacceptable.Additionally, the recent website redesign is a step backward. The new layout is confusing, cumbersome, and far more complex than the previous version. If something works well, why change it? The new interface makes navigation unnecessarily difficult, which only adds to the frustration when trying to resolve issues.For a company of this scale, I expected far better in both customer support and user experience. I hope Airbnb takes the feedback seriously and makes meaningful improvements.",2

"Avoidable cancellation, loss of trip and non-refundable event tickets, horrendous customer service experience","Extremely disappointing experience with Airbnb.I’ve been a loyal Airbnb customer for nearly a decade and have always had great experiences—until now. My recent booking for a weekend getaway was canceled due to what Airbnb claimed was a payment issue. The truth? My credit card had recently expired, and Airbnb made no effort to update the info, even though their own Terms of Service (2.4) say they can obtain updated details from my bank. No such attempt was made.Worse, they only notified me via email—which landed in spam. No messages through the Airbnb app, no texts, no calls. For a time-sensitive issue like this, relying solely on email is outdated and irresponsible—especially when their app is the primary way they communicate for everything else.I had a scheduled call with a case manager, which Airbnb completely mishandled. Instead of calling at the agreed 10:00 AM time, they tried to reach me at 1:00 AM (!), then closed my case when I didn’t answer. I had to spend a day and a half on the phone with multiple reps trying to sort it out—no resolution, just frustration.Even more baffling: they had a working card on file that had been charged successfully just two days earlier for another booking, yet never attempted to use it.In the end, the host—who had nothing to do with the issue—graciously issued a full refund, despite having to take a loss in profits for having to reduce the rental costs for a last minute booking.  Airbnb offered nothing. Because of their failure, three friends and I lost our accommodation, and $800 in nonrefundable event tickets. This was a trip we’d looked forward to all year, and I even took time off work for it. We missed it all.Airbnb needs to review and update their policy regarding expired cards. This was a completely preventable situation. Airbnb dropped the ball at every step. I expected better.",1

Worst Host Support,"I’ve been a host on Airbnb for five years. In the past, whenever there was a dispute regarding a guest’s review, customer support—based in the U.S.—was prompt, empathetic, and effective in understanding our concerns and taking swift action to resolve the issue.However, it now appears that support has been outsourced to countries like India or Bangladesh. Unfortunately, the current representatives seem to lack the authority or knowledge to take meaningful action. They strictly adhere to scripted guidelines and often repeat the same responses, even after multiple disputes and the submission of clear circumstantial evidence.Recently, a guest left a review accusing us of being scammers. When I raised this with support, I was told the comment was acceptable because it reflected the guest’s personal experience—completely disregarding the serious implications such a statement has on our integrity as hosts.",1

Unrealistic system with greedy air bnb owners,I have had TWO air bnb's cancel my reservations for next year in the last week so far. They have cancelled on the grounds that:1) they don't know what they will be charging for those dates yet next year2) they are keeping those dates for their regulars3) those dates may fall on a motorbike event and they want to review their prices for that week.I don't understand the purpose of this air bnb site to make bookings if the air bnb owners can decline on the above grounds. Why bother advertising them dates and wasting people's time if they have no intentions on confirming those bookings or they want to hike the prices up to extorianate prices for specific dates.Absolute waste of time using this system.The air bnb owners who are partaking in these unreasonable practices should hang their heads in shame!! Absolute greed on their part. Air bnb get some morals!!,1

"Airbnb’s support system is manipulative, dishonest and legally dangerous. This is a warning.","We booked a long-term stay in Mallorca via Airbnb and ended up in a health-threatening disaster:A 60-year-old house with black mold, damp walls, crumbling facades, and falsified listing photos – run by a so-called “Superhost” with 0 previous reviews.On April 23, 2025, we reported the situation to the host after discovering severe mold, decaying walls, and structural water damage.On May 6, 2025, we escalated the case to Airbnb – expecting protection, fairness, and transparency.We sent Airbnb dozens of timestamped proof photos, showing the horrific state of the property and walls literally rotting from the inside out, covered in mold, moisture, and decay.And yet, Airbnb kept believing the host’s absurd lies.The host refused to acknowledge the severity of the situation.He didn’t offer a refund, didn’t treat the damage as urgent, and had no alternative accommodation available.We were dependent on having a safe place to stay – and were forced to remain in a property that was medically dangerous.Airbnb was fully aware of this – and still chose to side with the host.They told us: “You probably caused it.”Really?You expect us to believe that an entire property developed deep black mold, structural moisture damage, and collapsed plaster in less than 20 days – simply because we stayed there?That’s not just nonsense – it’s insulting.We were told by one Airbnb support agent that we could receive a 30% refund.Then suddenly, a “Senior Escalations Manager” named Angel claimed that Airbnb’s policies only allow 10% maximum.We asked for proof.We asked for a clear clause in Airbnb’s terms.They refused.No documents. No links. No transparency.Then suddenly… the number changed again.We were offered €2,349.41 (≈30%) plus a €500 coupon, bringing the total “refund” to over 37%.But here’s where it becomes ethically disgusting:Airbnb told us we had 1 hour to accept the offer – or we would lose it forever.One hour.In the middle of a medically documented health crisis.We refused the manipulation.We responded calmly, with legal clarity, and insisted on our rights.And their response?❌ They shut down the chat❌ They blocked us from replying❌ And they “closed” the case – without a refund, without an agreement, and without accountabilityWe are now taking action via:– Balearic Tourism Authority (Mallorca)– Spanish Consumer Protection Agency (Consumo)– Legal counsel, due to proven health risk and misrepresentationAirbnb has ignored evidence, silenced the guest, protected a lying host, and used time pressure tactics instead of resolving the case properly.To everyone reading this:Do NOT trust Airbnb’s image.Their customer service system is broken, opaque, and dangerously unethical when it truly matters.Please share this review, repost it, and copy it to social media.Let the world see how Airbnb treats guests in crisis – with denial, blame-shifting, and silence.Case number: A48918488We will not stop until this is resolved – properly, fairly, and publicly.Tobi",1

Refuse to give my money back,"Title:Unfair Charge – No Help from Airbnb SupportReview:I had a very frustrating experience with Airbnb. While browsing the app, I accidentally confirmed a reservation. I realized the mistake immediately and canceled the booking within seconds. Despite this, Airbnb refuses to refund me or offer a credit, even though I never used the service or caused any cost to the host.What’s worse is that customer support has been completely unhelpful, giving me scripted responses and asking me to “wait 72 hours,” only to do nothing. I’ve spent days trying to resolve this and feel completely ignored.This is unacceptable customer service and an unfair policy. A simple human error shouldn’t cost a customer hundreds of dollars. Be very careful using the Airbnb app — their cancellation policy is ruthlessly inflexible, even in obvious error cases.I’ve filed a dispute with my bank and will think twice before ever booking with Airbnb again.⸻Would you like me to help you shorten it for Twitter or Instagram, or translate it to Spanish for a bilingual audience?",1
No Airbnb reviews after 14 days,"This  is a review of from a customer support perspective. I have been a customer of Airbnb for 12 years. I can say I have had mostly very good to great hosting and accommodation from this company. Recently we had two great  Airbnb experiences in Portugal and when I returned home I wanted to give them 5 star+ reviews. After further travel and catching up with business at home I sat down to write  reviews but was informed that I had passed a 14 day limit for reviews. I reviewed this policy and could find no good rationale or logic for it. I contacted customer support texted them and talked to them on the phone. The customer support center is obviously located as a call center probably in South Asia somewhere and the staff and senior advisors are handcuffed when it comes to this policy. They have no authority or discretion in making decisions. Obviously me writing a five star review would be good for the company, my Airbnb hosts and potential customers. Not going to happen-stonewalled with scripted responses. Wonder what would happen if we ran into some serious problems on the road.",2
"Discrimination tolerated, support dismissive — deeply disappointed in Airbnb","I had a deeply disappointing experience with a host on Airbnb who made offensive and inappropriate assumptions about me based on my nationality (Ukrainian) and language.After I answered a simple question slightly differently (but clearly), the host:•	Questioned my English skills, even though I’m fluent.•	Suggested I was using someone else’s account.•	Referenced my nationality in a suspicious way.•	Dug into my profile and emails to “verify” who I was.I withdrew the booking because I no longer felt safe or respected. I reported the host to Airbnb, expecting a serious review — but instead, I received a generic response saying there was “no violation of the Nondiscrimination Policy.”Despite sending screenshots and a clear explanation, my case was closed without action or follow-up. I requested escalation, but Airbnb ignored my messages completely.Airbnb claims to stand for inclusion, but my experience proves otherwise. Discrimination is not always loud or obvious — sometimes it’s subtle, patronizing, and just as harmful. And Airbnb’s unwillingness to address it seriously is unacceptable.I’ve lost trust in the platform’s ability to protect its users and uphold its values.",1

This isn't about star rating, it's about the property being unhygienic and unsafe with a back door accessible to the public that wouldn't lock.And the property listing? Mostly five star reviews.I will never book with Airbnb again. They don't care about their customers, only their hosts. There is nothing to hold hosts accountable for providing squalid conditions.",1

To my mind a property which has blocked drains, a tap which does not work, no bread knife in self catering and cupboard doors which fall off is not 5 star and yet everyone keeps saying they had a five star stay.  So, forget the star rating at the beginning, introduce more categories with comments for verification and clarification.  Start with equipment, standard of furnishings and the like and we will start to see more honest and useful reviews and the overall  score will be more accurate.

Airbnb a double edge sword for the host,"After spending thousands of dollars on setting up an apartment we have in our home we listed it with Airbnb. After the first several days, we were getting consistent bookings until one day. We got a booking on dates that we had blocked out on the calendar on the Airbnb site, which caused a conflict and no matter how we communicated to the people that were seeking the reservation, we were unable to contact the people, whether it was a problem through Airbnb or the people ignoring the message.The first time it was stated by the customer service on Airbnb that we had a switch turned on that allowed for automatic confirmation of bookings, which I explicitly had gone into the settings and turned off and when I explained it to them, they said that they wanted to go into the settings with me and turn it off while we were on the phone to be certain that it doesn’t occur again And that’s exactly what we did.After receiving numerous notifications of confirmations that we had not made, we contacted the company again and they told us it was an internal error and that they would correct the situation however, it will eventually cause us to have very low ratings and not be able to rent our apartment through Airbnb and they took no interest in that part of my concern.The next thing that I was trying to address was when I ask what country my call to Airbnb is being transferred to they flat out refuse, even though it’s very obvious that it is being routed through India, of which they refuse to admit that the call is going to India and they claim that they’re not allowed to tell us which is against the United States laws that they must tell The person who requests where the call is being routed by US law, but they continue to refuse.I have found in my short time that Airbnb does not care about the people who host on their site. They care about getting their money from their cut of the reservations and they redirect our calls through India even though many times the people on the phone from India are very in polite and do not listen and they talk through you and refuse to answer questions.It is becoming very very evident that I must list my apartment, which is very very nicely furnished, and everyone is overly happy with our hospitality, and I must list it dozens of other places because Airbnb has fallen off. It’s reputation drastically in a short period of time. The owner must be a trillionaire , but he’s fallen asleep at the switch and just living on the royalties I imagine.",3

While the guest was still on the street, they wrote that the apartment was not clean and gave it a one-star rating. They then requested a refund and canceled the booking. Airbnb staff asked us to remove the review, stating that the guest’s claims were untrue. However, Airbnb’s management kept the review, stating that the apartment was not good, despite knowing the guest was on the street and never even entered the building.

Their policy is profit first, people last.Let me be blunt: this company is a soulless machine, and their so-called ""support"" process is a joke.

This is not only absurd — it’s blatant victim-blaming. I requested Airbnb remove the review under their own policies (which prohibit false and retaliatory comments), but they’ve failed to act.Worse still, the property is still listed — meaning other guests could be put at risk. Airbnb talks a big game about guest safety, but my experience shows how easily they let hosts get away with dangerous conditions and dishonest conduct, even when reported.This experience has completely destroyed my trust in Airbnb. I expected a safe place to stay — not to be trapped and publicly defamed.",1

We checked out on April 1, and while packing to leave the country, we discovered cash missing from three different wallets stored in separate places inside the apartment:•	My wallet (in my backpack in the living room) had foreign currencies I’d collected over years—worth ~$100.•	My wife’s wallet (hidden in her bag in the bedroom) had 200 euros, a gift from her sister after our baby was born.•	A change wallet, visible in the living room, had a $5 note with symbolic value.We didn’t use these wallets during the trip—we relied on Apple Pay and credit cards—so we only realized the money was gone when we started packing.No one had access to the unit except the host’s cleaner, who last visited on March 30. We contacted the host—no help. Airbnb support—no help. Then I filed a BBB complaint.Airbnb responded to the BBB multiple times saying I was “working with a specialized support team,” but I had not received a single message. After I followed up again, I was finally contacted over a week later—only to be told to “be patient.”The most frustrating part? Airbnb refuses to let me leave a review because their system only allows 14 days after checkout—even though the theft was only discovered after we left.I’m not asking for a refund—just to share my experience honestly so others can protect themselves. But Airbnb is actively preventing me from doing even that.",1
A complete Joke,"The support system of Airbnb has become a complete joke for hosts... They spam you almost daily to publish your experience, and when you do follow their exact steps, there is not publish button. I tried multiple times to request help from Airbnb support only to get calls from them in random hours, I'd pick up and they'd hang up, or they would respond in the chat with pretty much automatic responses with no regard to the problem. This has been very frustrating, delays and stalls my experience and most of all, wastes a lot of energy by having to focus on all this Airbnb nonsense... This company has become a complete joke.",1
Cancelled,Booked a place for one night in Sunderland. Host cancelled - no explanation given. What gets me is that I cannot leave a review to warn other potential users of this property. You can only do this if the host cancels within 24 hours of check in. Makes me very wary of using Airbnb if they are hiding valuable information like this.,1
"Misleading listing, no Gulf access – Airbnb protects host, not guestI booked a house on Airbnb that was…","I booked a house on Airbnb that was promoted as having “Gulf Access” in Cape Coral. This feature was central to my booking decision, as I had planned to rent a boat. Upon arrival, I found that the canal access had been blocked for months due to construction — something Airbnb and the host were informed about well in advance. This was never disclosed in the listing.Despite clear evidence, Airbnb refused to offer fair compensation and merely issued a token refund of CHF 200. The host took no responsibility, and Airbnb chose to protect the host rather than the guest.This was a classic case of misrepresentation by omission, and it turned my once-a-year holiday into a frustrating experience. I’ve filed a formal complaint through my credit card provider and will never use Airbnb again for travel.",1
Prone to cancellations,"Prone to cancellations by hosts and, it turns out, when this happens, Airbnb penalises the host financially and keeps the money for themselves rather than pass it on to the person who’s been let down. Furthermore, when you make a complaint against a member of staff, that same staff member deals with the complaint themselves. Hardly a transparent process.",1
As a host,"As a host, Airbnb has provided terrible customer service. They don't seem to understand what the topic is as they simply cannot answer simple questions.

Due to school pick-up, London traffic, and Eurotunnel delays, we arrived at 11:30pm instead of 10pm. The host, Rodolphe, had initially agreed to a late check-in and said the agency (Mélanie) would hand over the keys.But when we arrived:❌ Mélanie refused to give us the keys❌ Rodolphe cancelled the booking on the spot❌ They ignored our calls and messages❌ Airbnb couldn’t find us alternative accommodation❌ They suggested we find a hotel ourselves & offered 20% off the first night booking as a gesture of goodwillWe were stranded in the middle of nowhere with everything shut.After calling every possible hotel in the area, we managed to find a hotel 1 hour away.It was 3am by the time.Our kids had to sleep in the car half of the night.This is not just bad service – it’s inhumane.📢 We demand:1️⃣ Full refund of the Airbnb stay2️⃣ Refund of our emergency hotel3️⃣ Refund of the 2 extra nights we had to rebook4️⃣ That Airbnb bans this host from the platform5️⃣ A real emergency support system for familiesAirbnb, this is a disgrace.

"HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!, NOT WITH AIRBNB","To Airbnb the client is the less important part.Do you know that the terms and conditions never help you?If you have an issue and is under the Airbnb cancellation policies, really not. Finally, depends on the host's decision. Is that Inese from Airbnb told me by phone. She denied informing in a written message. You paid you lose",1
Airbnb is Like Communism-Great in Theory,"I am staying at a disgusting Airbnb right now. I am afraid to leave a negative review when we leave because it is well known that hosts also review guests. If you leave a bad review you will get a bad review. The problem? You don't know you are getting a bad review and cannot defend yourself.There is only a short window of time to leave your review, so they know exactly who left it. There is no anonymity.We paid good money for a whole house with a fenced in yard to stay with our two dogs, which are better behaved than most kids these days, and this place is a dump. Despite contacting the host directly to confirm that the yard is completely fenced in and receiving a confirmation of that fact, as soon as we got here, before even getting in the house, our one dog went behind the garage and around it and freely walked out and took a three hour tour of Erie, PA, including a swim in the bay to chase the ducks and geese.The bay is several miles from the house and he crossed several busy streets. He could have been killed and could possibly have killed or injured people driving who would likely swerve to avoid hitting him and there's nothing funny about that.(And, yes, we did check out the fence before letting him off lead. We couldn't get behind the garage to the other side and it looked to be closed off from our vantage point.)The house is filled with furniture out of Goodwill. Actually the furniture at Goodwill is probably better. They listed minimum rules on the website and then there was a whole list on the fridge when we got here-including taking the garbage out and placing it on the curb the evening we arrived. No, not our garbage. There are holes in the ceilings and the walls that have been patched poorly. There is a big hole in the bedroom ceiling patched with bare plywood.I could go and on, but you get the point. Coffee included. The cheapest possible coffee maker and cheapest possible coffee with dollar store brand creamer. No name shampoo, etc., etc.Never using Airbnb again and calling them when we get home.",1

"Protects TIME WASTING hosts, no support to customers…","The first property I booked for my hen fell through less than 24 hours after booking it, which was not ideal BUT it still gave us plenty of notice to find something else suitable, and the host gave a valid explanation as to why the booking was cancelled.My second airbnb host cancelled less than 24 hours before check in without explanation, when this trip has been booked for months. We were a group of 8 needing space, so unsurprisingly we subsequently couldn't rebook ANYTHING suitable so last minute. When trying to complain and write a review about the awful treatment we received to warn other users, Airbnb ""support"" were completely useless, did not help at all and protected the rubbish host.I'm disappointed that I can't even write a bad review. I had a whole hen weekend of activities booked in bath so needed accommodation in the city and when she cancelled so last minute there was absolutely nothing else available to accommodate 8 people. We needed a space for house/board games to accommodate a pregnant member of the group so going out/hotel was not an option.The host was allowed to cancel without explanation, and I cannot even warn other users against this. It put a huge downer on my hen weekend!!! Especially knowing that if it was us that had cancelled so last minute we would have had to pay a fee! And she just gets away with it.I am so utterly disappointed.I have closed my account. No point of Airbnb offering to send a discount for future bookings when the trip has been and gone, and this whole experience caused so many tears and distress on a weekend that was SUPPOSED to be fun.I will never be booking through Airbnb again.

This negligence creates ongoing issues for residents, including mess, noise, and disrespect for shared spaces.

Great customer service!,We had a problem recently where one of their hosts was not replying to or confirming our reservation.This meant that we had nowhere to stay and we were on a long distance walk with no transportation.We found alternative accommodation and Airbnb refunded our original fee as well as reimbursing us for the cost difference for the new accommodation as well as the cost of the taxi to get us there. This happened two days ago and the refund was processed the same day.Fantastic customer service!,5

A Heartbreaking Experience with OYO…,"A Heartbreaking Experience with OYO Rooms & Airbnb – A Night No One DeservesWe had booked an OYO room on Stade Street, Kent (CT21 6DT, UK) a week in advance through Airbnb, trusting both brands to deliver a safe and reliable stay. What we experienced was the complete opposite – a night of stress, fear, and abandonment that no human being, especially a pregnant woman, should ever have to endure.Due to traffic and unavoidable delays, we arrived late — around 1:30 AM — only to be told over the phone by someone claiming to be from OYO that we couldn't check in because the hotel only accepts check-ins until 11 PM. We were shocked. We were literally just around the corner, exhausted, and hoping for some rest — especially with my wife being 8 months pregnant.Instead, we were told we had to pay an additional £50 to check in. Reluctantly, I agreed, just wanting to get my wife into a warm bed. But then, after holding the line for 20 minutes, they claimed they couldn't reach the reception — essentially admitting there was no one there. The £50 fee felt like nothing more than a tactic, with no real intention of helping us.I even got out of the car and knocked at the hotel door, hoping someone might respond. No one did. My pregnant wife and I stood helpless on an empty street, in the dead of night, cold and alone.Airbnb was no better. I called them, explained the situation, and they said they would reach out to OYO and get back to us within 30 minutes. No one called. I called again. Nothing. Two major companies that promise safety, comfort, and support failed us completely when we needed them most.We waited outside for nearly two hours — in disbelief, in fear, and in utter emotional exhaustion.What makes it worse is knowing that OYO's founder built his company after he once faced a similar experience, locked out of a hotel himself. That pain inspired him to build a brand that would never let anyone else go through that again. But last night, we went through the exact same pain. Only now, his brand – which started with heart – has become unrecognizable.This was not just poor service. It was a failure of compassion, of duty, and of the very values these companies claim to represent.We will never book with OYO again. And for the first time, we’re questioning our trust in Airbnb too. A place to sleep at night is a basic human need. And on this night, that need was cruelly denied.",1
Airbnb broke a written promise after 10 years of loyalty,"I’ve been an Airbnb guest for over 10 years and have rented a room at 12900 Wedding Drive, Manor, TX for 365 consecutive nights, paying $800/month. During a stay in Mexico City (April 19–20, 2025), I had a poor experience. Airbnb support (Mike) resolved it by issuing a $35 refund and promising a 50% discount coupon for a future reservation — in writing.Later, Airbnb refused to honor the coupon, claiming it was an error. I have a screenshot of the message. They closed the case and denied further support, despite clear written evidence.As a loyal customer who has spent nearly $10,000 over the past year alone, this is incredibly disappointing. Airbnb made a written promise and broke it — this is unethical and unacceptable.I’ve filed complaints with the BBB and the Texas Attorney General. If Airbnb fails to correct this, I will escalate to arbitration.",1
Airbnb Sides with Guest Leaving False Retaliatory Review – Hosts Beware,"I've been a host on Airbnb for over 5 years with consistently excellent reviews and a well-maintained property. Recently, a guest caused considerable damage to my caravan. I submitted a reimbursement request through Airbnb with photographic evidence provided by a professional third-party cleaning team.In response, the guest left a false and retaliatory review, claiming I was rude, that the property was in poor condition, and that I fabricated the damage. None of these issues were mentioned during or immediately after the stay—only after the reimbursement request was submitted.Despite providing Airbnb with clear message history disproving the guest’s claims, they refused to remove the review. Even more disappointing was the rude and abrupt attitude I received from Airbnb support staff on the phone. The senior case manager spoke to me with a ""couldn’t care less"" attitude and offered no valid reason for allowing the review to stand.Airbnb’s Review Policy supposedly prohibits retaliatory or misleading reviews, but in reality, they do not protect their hosts—even when the evidence is clear.Prospective hosts, be warned: Airbnb will not support you when a guest leaves a defamatory or retaliatory review. You're on your own.Update 11th MayDue to my multiple complaints to AirBnB as they wouldn't explain how the guest's review met their policy guidelines in retaliatory content I submitted a subject access request to get to the bottom of it myself. Within a few hours of submitting this request AirBnB removed my listing.I'm now letting through Vrbo and Direct Holiday Homes. Vrbo is 100 times better so I highly recommend any owners switching to Vrbo if you facing issues with AirBnB. Vrbo called me up and talked me through the whole set up of my listing on the phone and I have a dedicated contact I can email at Vrbo if I face any issues. Vrbo also lists your property on all of the Expedia group websites, amazing!",1

"£31,000 payment demand 10 months in advance and then dreadful support service! is Found the perfect for our holiday…","Found the perfect house for our holiday in Florida for Feb 2026. The booking was for 29 days at a cost of around £30,000. Upon booking the Airbnb system asked for full payment in advance. Yes that's £31,000 in full at least 10 months before the booking date! Of course I was happy to pay a material deposit of 50% but expected to pay the remaining 50% nearer the start date like every other booking I've made with Airbnb. I contacted Customer support who told me it was their policy to demand full payment if the booking is over 28days!!So, I wondered where my £30,000 paid to Airbnb would reside for 10 months and why I should lose out on any interest that such an amount may earn during that 10 month period if it was not sat in Airbnb's bank!

refund promise refund promise broken – Airbnb leaves host stranded,"I’ve been a reliable and well-rated Airbnb host for years. On Easter Sunday, a guest asked to check in much earlier than allowed. I clearly confirmed the regular check-in time (3pm) via Airbnb messages.Despite this, the guest canceled. Shortly afterward, an Airbnb support agent called me directly and told me I’d receive a full payout if I agreed not to rebook the apartment for that period. I agreed – and I kept the place blocked.Now, weeks later, I’m told I won’t be paid because I was “unreachable.”That is simply untrue. I responded via Airbnb AND WhatsApp. I have full proof of communication.I’ve requested escalation to a case manager or supervisor multiple times – no response, just generic replies.This is a breach of trust and a broken verbal agreement from Airbnb’s side.As a host, I feel abandoned and misled – despite having done everything right.I hope Airbnb will take responsibility and provide a resolution. If not, I will escalate this case further – legally and publicly.If anyone has had similar experiences with Airbnb, feel free to reach out. I’m open to exchange and potential collective action.",1
Awful Customer Support – Completely Unreliable in Critical Situations,"I’ve had two deeply disappointing and unacceptable experiences with Airbnb’s customer support that have completely destroyed my trust in the platform.The first situation occurred during a trip to Morocco. The listing I had booked turned out to be a nightmare — there was no Wi-Fi as advertised, ongoing noisy reconstruction work, and the place was extremely dirty. I couldn’t stay there, so I contacted Airbnb support expecting help. Instead, I was passed from one representative to another in endless back-to-back calls that lasted the entire day. They kept “looking into it” but never actually did anything. I was left without a place to stay in the middle of the night. No emergency listing. No help. Just exhaustion, stress, and frustration. This alone was enough to make me question the reliability of the platform.The second experience was even more disturbing. I recently reported a host who replied to guest reviews with racist comments — a clear violation of Airbnb’s policies. In addition, I experienced serious health issues and even personal attacks during my stay, all of which I documented in detail and submitted to Airbnb. Despite this, they didn’t take any action for two days. Their only response was to repeatedly ask me vague questions like “How can we assist you?” even though I had already provided detailed context and documentation. They have access to the full chat history, know exactly what happened, and yet chose to delay and ignore rather than act.Airbnb clearly has the tools and data to respond quickly, but instead chooses to stall and deflect. This isn’t just poor customer service — it’s outright negligence, especially when guest safety and well-being are at stake.I will never use Airbnb again. There are alternative platforms out there with responsive and responsible support teams. If you’re tempted by slightly cheaper listings, remember that you’re also gambling with your safety and peace of mind. For me, it’s simply not worth the risk.",1
My friend and I booked a property in…,"My friend and I booked a property in Morocco through Airbnb for seven nights. On the fourth night, after inviting guests over, we were harassed and threatened by individuals claiming to be related to high-ranking authorities. They demanded we remove our guests due to the proximity of a mosque. When we refused, we were warned of serious consequences.Fearing for our safety, we were forced to leave the property the following morning. Despite reporting the incident to Airbnb and requesting a refund for the remaining nights, our request was denied — and my account was unfairly suspended without clear explanation.We were the ones placed in a threatening and unsafe situation, yet Airbnb offered no real support or protection. This was a deeply distressing experience, and I expected better from a platform that claims to prioritize guest safety.",1
Airbnb lets host down,"we have hosted on airbnb for almost 9 years and have 4.95, superhost rating. Yet a guest recently claimed the accommodation was ""unacceptable"" supported by photos of hard water stains in the kettle and shower. This enabled them to escape their 1 week booking commitment and get full refund - and at 8.30pm they clearly had alternative (probably with family) accommodation ready. Airbnb's handling was aggressive, citing that there would be ""consequences"" if we didnt refund despite years of delighted guests.",3

Airbnb Sided With a Host Who Submitted Fraudulent Evidence – Serious Security Risk,"Me and my wife booked a place downtown through Airbnb that looked fine in the pictures. The host was responsive, but when we arrived, we were shocked by the condition: dust all over appliances, food stains embedded into furniture, and even leftover food on the countertops. We paid a cleaning fee, yet the host suggested sending a cleaner during our stay, which we refused—why should we be inconvenienced for a mistake that should never have happened?We took photos and left a fair 4-star review (despite the condition) because the host was new to Airbnb. In return, we were accused of extortion—the host submitted doctored, fraudulent evidence claiming we demanded money to delete our review. This was completely false. We had zero communication with the host outside of Airbnb, and we have full proof of this.Airbnb accepted the fraudulent evidence without verifying it. Even worse, they confirmed the alleged conversation happened outside their platform, raising a terrifying question: How did the host get our private phone number? Airbnb is supposed to protect guest information, yet our number was clearly accessed, spoofed, or worse—used to fabricate a false narrative against us.Despite our repeated attempts to provide evidence disproving the host’s claims, Airbnb refused to help and took the host’s side. They dismissed our concerns, ignored the potential identity theft, and essentially allowed a host to get away with criminal activity.This is not just about a bad stay—this is about Airbnb enabling fraud, negligence, and security violations. If a host can forge evidence and Airbnb doesn’t have the tools or willingness to detect that, EVERY guest is at risk.The host’s name: Sk Ali. Be warned—there may be more like him. Airbnb clearly does not do forensic verification of screenshots or claims, and they clearly don’t have a proper security or fraud investigation team.Airbnb is failing to protect its guests. If you've been affected by a similar situation, speak up. This platform is not safe.",1

And complained about things that was clearly described in listing description and clearly visible on all photos. She knew what she is booking and her complaints makes no sense. But Airbnb refuses to remove her review only because she wrapped it up in nice words with 2* rating. This people have no common sense. I'm considering to remove my listing from here.",2
Good Stay,"Good Stay, But Airbnb’s Platform Could ImproveI booked a weekend stay in a downtown apartment through Airbnb in April 2025. The place was clean and matched the description, and the host was friendly enough, responding to my check-in questions within a few hours. However, the booking process was frustrating—the app glitched when I tried to confirm my dates, and I had to contact Airbnb support to fix it. Their customer service was polite but took two days to resolve the issue, which was stressful so close to my trip.

They don't want to give refunds.,"I've booked a place, got the reply from the host that they cancel due to the price mistake made by Airbnb. Customer service didn't want to send a refund to my bank account, instead they insisted on Airbnb credit, added 22 euros as an ""extra refund"" but when I kept demanding a full refund to my bank account, customer service person offered me an extra voucher for 400 euros and help on finding a replacement for the canceled booking.I had to find my own replacement because the guy kept sending me wrong options, but he never finished the rebooking.Customer service stopped responding on my messages, so I called them. I had to talk to 3 different people, who were saying different thing but none of them helped me.They were doing everything not to help me.I have wasted 4 hours of my time and the issue is still unsolved.It is one of the worst experiences I've had with any kind of serviced in my life.

I have been a host off and on since…,"I have been a host off and on since 2020--right when COVID hit. I sold that house with the attached apt and really had no issues with guests or the site. The next time I was a host, I had issues from day one! If it weren't for the necessity of the extra income, I would not deal with this hassle. Most of my guest really are great! Then I get those that want Michelin quality on soup kitchen price. I live in my home and rent a room (rented both spare rooms for over a year with minimal issues). But lately, they are not host supportive. Guest lie about the space and they take the guest word even when they contradict themselves! No one reads the listing, show up and make demands of things I have no control over or complain of things listed in the description. They put on a happy 'I love the place face' and then tear the place down with the review.  It's only to get a discount or free stay--they know the key words to use for this when they talk to the site. As a guest, I have traveled a few places and  only once did I have an issue, took photos of dirt, bugs and even had the agent on the site agree they mislead where the location was. But that time, they took the hosts side! There is no rhyme or reason.",3

I’ve been a loyal Airbnb user for…6,"I’ve been a loyal Airbnb user for years, but unfortunately, my recent experience was pretty disappointing.During a recent trip, I had to leave my Airbnb early because of a serious safety concern — I returned to the rental to find the front door unlocked and all the lights on, even though I had secured everything before leaving. I immediately contacted the host and Airbnb, followed all the right steps, and ended up relocating to a hotel at my own expense.Even though I provided tons of documentation (hotel confirmations, messages, everything they asked for), Airbnb ultimately refused to help reimburse me — even though I had to completely drain my hotel points to rebook safely and quickly. Their final response basically boiled down to: “Sorry, we can’t help you because you used points.”It’s really disappointing to realize that even when you prioritize your safety and do everything you’re supposed to do, Airbnb doesn’t truly stand behind their guests. This experience made me rethink how much I can trust Airbnb when something actually goes wrong.Just sharing for anyone else who thinks guest protection is guaranteed — unfortunately, that wasn’t my experience.",1
"6+ Yr. Superhost Suspended, No Explanation, Ghosted","After over 6 years of being a dedicated super host who bends over backwards for my Airbnb guests including taking things from my own house to give to them. My worst review ever was three stars. There's just one. I wake up to a suspended account. All my listings suspended. 4 days in a row I called. They tell me a specialized team is working on it and they will get back to me in 24 hours. They tell me this 3 days in a row. Yesterday I call and they said oh it's escalated, again for the fourth time, and someone will get back to me by the end of the day. Nobody called. Now I can't even send messages to the help center. It's blocked or just goes to nowhere and deletes. When I try to call I get left on eternal hold. So Airbnb has blackballed and ghosted me and suspended my account for unknown reasons. This is New York State they are operating in. The law here says I must receive details about the witness and the witness statement. I will take them to court. If you're reading this Airbnb, I don't just talk. I make moves. I will take you to court if you do not provide me with the witness statement that you are legally obligated to provide me with in the state of New York. You think you want to ban my account for unknown reasons 2 weeks before one of the busiest travel holidays in America? When I had options and I could have built my reputation with over 150 stays somewhere else? This is why people can't stand corporate America. You put your heart and soul into a business relationship with these fools, and they crap on you and treat you like trash. Corporate America you can kick rocks. I do not need you to make a living. And I'm not a Snow White. Oh, and that thing about providing me with witness info that you are legally provided required to provide me with in the state of New York because you are doing business with me in the state of New York, I will drag your arses to court. I do all the legal work myself until it comes time for the courtroom appearance. So just don't.

Airbnb treats hosts like slaves,"I've been hosting for 10 years with my 3 properties and this is the first time I looked into these reviews here. I wish I had looked it sooner. Over the past 2 years there has been a huge increase of guests abusing their refund rights and profiting from Airbnb 'guests protection policies', fabricating issues, producing fake pictures, getting no quibble refund and then leaving defamatory reviews. This almost always happens after their few days of stay, so they end up having free accommodation in central London. Airbnb continues to send their pre-set automated template responses, taking off my payouts as they like, allowing guests to cause damages to my properties without compensating as per their 'Host protection' policies. Then further allowing guests to post discriminatory, defamatory and retaliatory reviews. Any attempt to prove your case ends with automated, pre set response, refusing to remove the reviews which clearly violate their policies. And you end up taking all these abuses from disrespectful guests and Airbnb. After 10 years working so hard to build a decent reputation on this platform, I will be removing my properties from it, as I can no longer take this mental abuse.",1

"Airbnb Failed to Provide Safety, Support After Traumatic Burglary — Now Silencing Guest Reviews","We had an incredibly traumatic experience staying at an Airbnb property (House: Corteza Miel, in Cabo Velas, Costa Rica - Host: Rosario). While we were asleep, burglars broke into all four bedrooms and stole over $21,000 worth of valuables, including phones, jewelry, laptops, and cash. Despite the listing claiming a secure, high-end home with gated access and surveillance, security was nonexistent: the side gate was broken, the alarm system was never shown to us, and cameras only covered the front entrance.After reporting the crime, Airbnb’s response was appalling. We were given no meaningful support, no help processing the ""AirCover"" insurance, and no resolution after hours of calls with untrained agents. To make matters worse, when I posted a review warning future guests, Airbnb allowed the host’s defamatory response to stay. Even after I complained, Airbnb refused to remove it. Eventually, they removed both my review and the host’s response, erasing the incident entirely.Airbnb failed to protect us, failed to provide any real support, and failed to uphold their own policies — while silencing safety warnings for future guests. This is not just poor service, it’s negligence and dangerous for anyone staying with them.Be aware before you book!",1
Unfair review policy and refusal to remove false guest feedback,"I had a guest who booked a private room in my apartment (clearly stated as ""room in a shared apartment"" in the listing). After their stay, they left a 1-star review saying they were “shocked” that other people live in the apartment — even though it was obvious from the listing, filters, and booking confirmation that it was not an entire place.I contacted Airbnb support, provided all evidence, and explained that this was not about the quality of the accommodation but simply the guest’s own mistake and misunderstanding of what they booked.However, Airbnb refused to remove the review, claiming it reflects “the guest’s experience.” But how can a guest’s misunderstanding of the booking type justify damaging a host’s reputation? This is not a matter of “experience” — this is a clear example of false and misleading feedback.As a host, I feel completely unprotected from unfair reviews caused by guests who don’t read the listing properly. Airbnb’s review policy allows for abuse and damages honest hosts without any real recourse.Very disappointed with the way support handled this situation and ignored all facts I provided.",1

I booked & fully paid for this place, host confirmed my payment & even left me instructions getting into the house the day before I was supposed to go there.  We were notified the DAY OF by email from Airbnb that our host cancelled.  No reason, no explanation.  I immediately called to see what our options were & it took 10 HOURS (no exaggeration) to find another (more expensive) place. Told at least 4 different people we couldn’t afford more money & Airbnb needed to reimburse the difference since this was beyond our control & it was their host (Worse yet, found out the host did this to other people previously!!). Finally spoke with a supervisor who said they would reimburse us if I paid upfront.  I did, but never received reimbursement.  I called repeatedly, but finally gave up after 3 months.

Worst Airbnb Experience,"Worst Airbnb Experience – Beware of This Host! Elegant 3-Bedroom Cottage with Private Sauna Carlingfordhosted by:Stefan Breen and Christina Breen.I want to warn others before they make the same mistake I did. I booked this Airbnb expecting a decent stay and at least honest communication — I got neither.The host initially agreed to refund me after I decided not to go through with the stay. We had a conversation, and they assured me the refund would be processed once I cancelled. Based on that trust, I cancelled the booking.But when Airbnb followed up with the host to process the refund, they completely changed their tune and suddenly decided to stick to their cancellation policy, refusing to give me back a single cent. So basically, I was lied to, manipulated into cancelling, and then they pocketed the money anyway. Dishonest, unprofessional, and completely unethical.If you’re thinking about booking this place — don’t. I wouldn’t trust this host with anything, let alone your holiday plans or your hard-earned money. This experience has been a complete nightmare, and it’s shameful behaviour on the part of both the host and how Airbnb allows this kind of thing to happen.",1

AirBnB Aircover  not worth the paper it’s written on,"I am a host on AirBnB. Over the Easter weekend Airbnb placed guests in my property who held an all-night party with drugs and kept the entire neighbourhood awake.  These guests smashed our home and did £2.5k worth of damage.  The police were involved.  The guest who booked our home had already received a review for similar behaviour from another host but yet was deemed by AirBnB as being of suitable calibre to book again with another host.When I tried to claim the costs of damages from Airbnb’s AirCover scheme they made it as difficult as possible - asking for receipts of kitchen equipment that was installed 10 years ago, asking me to explain how the damage was done (when the guests were consuming drugs and I wasn’t there) and informing me they would not cover the cost replacing the locks after the guests took the house keys.  It seemed their safety policy allows guests like this to retain keys to properties that they have taken drugs at and trashed, which in my view represents a huge safety issue.I appreciate that incidents do occur and that they are often unexpected.  But how they are recovered is also important.  In this situation I felt completely abandoned by AirBnB.  They were more interested in wrapping layers or bureaucracy around the process, providing non genuine statements of support and in closing down the case regardless of whether it was resolved or not.Their behaviour has been appalling and has confirmed to me that they really do not care about either hosts or guests.If you have a rental property, think carefully about whether you want Airbnb to be your broker.  Because they are exactly that - just a broker.  If anything goes wrong you’ll be completely on your own. They do not care.",1

I Airbnb ignores my discrimination report against a host,"I submitted an official complaint to Airbnb about a host named Scott who made discriminatory, offensive, and humiliating comments toward me. He refused to rent his property to me solely because I speak Russian. He questioned whether I truly live in the U.S., even though I have been living here for 7 years and my identity is fully verified on Airbnb.Worse, he mocked the way I spelled my own name and added a sarcastic “ha-ha” — clearly ridiculing and disrespecting me in the conversation.I attached screenshots and submitted the complaint through Airbnb’s official channels. Days have passed, and I still haven’t received any response. Complete silence.I expected Airbnb to take discrimination and xenophobia seriously, but it seems like they’re turning a blind eye. For a platform that claims to be built on inclusivity, safety, and trust, this is deeply disappointing.No follow-up. No apology. No accountability.

"Airbnb left my unstable host on the platform — unsafe for guests, and deeply unfair to her","About two weeks ago, I had a disturbing experience with an Airbnb host in France. She was elderly, clearly unwell — emotionally and mentally — and completely overwhelmed. Her communication was erratic, and her behavior became unpredictable. I trusted my instincts and left early, for my own safety.But what shocked me most? Airbnb did nothing.I reported everything in detail. They treated it like a standard support case, closed it quietly, and left her listing live. No follow-up. No accountability.Yes, I was the guest at risk. But this is about more than one booking.This woman should not be hosting strangers. She’s struggling — and continuing to host puts everyone in danger: the guests, but also her. She could be manipulated, harmed, or trigger a serious incident. Airbnb’s inaction isn’t just careless — it’s irresponsible.Airbnb talks a lot about “trust and safety,” but where’s the empathy?Not just for travelers — but for hosts who clearly need support, not five-star pressure.This isn’t a rant. It’s a wake-up call.Safety isn’t just about locks and listings. Sometimes, the most compassionate — and most responsible — thing a platform can do is say: This host needs care, not a new guest.(And yes, I tried to post this in r/Airbnb. I got banned. Maybe that says something too.)",1

The dishwasher didn’t work, the dishes were dirty, with hardly and mismatched silverware, and I’ve been stuck 10 days without a key to the building — unable to enter without relying on the host. Loud, daily thumping noises made it nearly impossible to work or rest.Airbnb’s “Aircover” failed me. They offered no real relocation help and now threaten to withhold refund eligibility because I “chose to stay” — as if I had other options while traveling with dogs and belongings, and no replacement was provided.Despite a BBB complaint, photos, and proof that the listing remains falsely advertised, Airbnb continues to downplay the severity and shift the blame. Even on Easter Sunday, they sent messages attempting to limit refunds and close the case — rather than resolve it.I’m putting this out publicly because no one should be stranded or gaslit like this by a global platform.

last-MINUTE-canceled by host,"This is a review towards AirBnbs customerservice and their guest-HOSTILE-policies/guidelines.My last experience with AirBnb briefly summarized:* When guests last-minute-cancels/no show, they lose all their money.* When host last-minute-cancels without prior notice, they get a strike and a small penalty-fee. The guests bear all the additional expenses related to the cancellation by their host.Longer version:Unfortunately my last booking got cancelled at last minute by my host, that happend when I've already arrived at their destination/doorstep. I informed them about my arrival, and the only response I received from the host right before the cancellation, was their short apology and that they ""THOUGHT"" they have informed me the day before about the cancellation.This was by far the most disgusting behaviour I have ever faced, absolutely lack of respect of others. Iam shocked how AirBnb allows such trash of a human being able to operate on their platform. Due to the cancellation, I was also unable to leave a ""HONEST"" review of this host. (This again makes me suspicious if many of the reviews on AirBnB truly are inflated, as it seems negativity are mostly being avoided.)Took some time to finally reach customerservice and i did express the frustration about the whole situation. Customerservice agents kept responding with automated generated nonsense about how ""sorry"" they were for my inconvenience, a full refund being issued, host getting a strike/penalty, etc. They also insisted on phone-calls, but I demanded all dialogue to be in written form just for the sake of documentation.After 7-8 hours of contact and threats of reporting AirBnb, they eventuelly gave in with an additional 50% compensation on top of the full refund. But in exchange I wasted one full day of my vacation.With all that being said, 95% of my experiences on AirBnb has been positive. Most of the people I've met are truly honest, kind and hard-working.Sadly, I'll refrain myself using this platform until they provide customer-protection against hosts who last-minute-cancels WITHOUT assisting guest in search for alternatives. I dont want to gamble with my holidays like this, lessons learned this time.",1

A waste of time and contradictory.,"I contacted “Manon” for accommodation in Montpellier. My request was rejected. The organisation “preferred”, she said, people with reviews. (Having only started using Airbnb recently and not yet stayed at any of its establishments, I have no reviews.) I was thanked, incorrectly and presumptuously, for my “understanding”. Whereas I can sympathise, such a blanket and judgemental stance is unacceptable, and when it is found out, it ought to be called out. I called AirBNB as I had a message to say a “Refund” MAY be on its way. I raised the issue of money being taken from my account when the Host never intended to take my booking in the first place – ‘false pretence’ in my book – and asked what steps could be taken to ensure others wouldn’t be subjected to the same experience. I suggested that those who did not want to receive bookings from people without reviews should have it written on their profile, saving people from wasting time and expense. The Call Handler was simply disinterested – nothing would be done. I asked to speak to the supervisor and was told one would call “within 40 minutes”; no call was ever received. If Airbnb Call Handlers make it up as they go along – lie in other people’s terms – how can we trust those who provide accommodation to do any better? I will sign out of Airbnb once I have enjoyed my stay with kinder hosts than “Manon” appears to be, once and for all.

"Failure to deal with simple issue, fobbed off with no complaints department","I am a host and have been trying now for nearly 8 weeks to get the description of my property changed to accurately reflect that it is in a national park, after Airbnb inserted incorrect information without any discussion with me. It seems there is an error in the technical department, but I keep getting fobbed off time and time again. Apparently, there is no complaints department so it is impossible to complain, and even though people are messaging me, it is with the same platitudinous commentary that I’ve been getting for 7 weeks now without any resolution. Extraordinarily frustrating and certainly not a positive experience as a host.",1
Airbnb Promised a Refund - On a Recorded Line - Then Changed Their Mind,"I’m extremely disappointed with how Airbnb handled my recent experience. I booked a property in New Orleans back in January for a late April stay. At the time of booking, the listing had no reviews, but the host had solid reviews on other properties, so I trusted it.In February, a new review appeared saying the apartment was dirty and UNSAFE. I also noticed that the listing was misleading, claiming the location was within walking distance to bars and restaurants—but the times listed were clearly for driving. I tried reaching out to the host to express my concerns, but never received a response.The host’s cancellation policy only allowed a 50% refund, but given the new review and misleading description, I contacted Airbnb directly to request a full refund.Over the course of several days, I had 13 separate phone calls with Airbnb support, spending over 2 hours explaining the situation repeatedly because no one seemed to read the case history. It was frustrating, but I kept following the process in good faith.Finally, on Thursday, April 17th at 18:46, an Airbnb representative told me—on a recorded call—that I would be receiving a full refund, and even offered to help me rebook a new place. Based on that, I booked another Airbnb later that same night.Then, at 1:23AM on Saturday, while I was asleep, I received a message from Airbnb saying I would not be getting a full refund after all!!!This kind of inconsistency and lack of accountability from customer support is absolutely unacceptable. I followed every step, trusted Airbnb’s word, and acted in good faith—and now they have gone back on their word and I’m stuck paying for it!Airbnb has lost my trust, and I strongly urge others to think twice before booking. If anything goes wrong, don’t expect their support team to back you up—even when they promise to.",1
Airbnb always seems to side with the…,"Airbnb always seems to side with the host. After reading reviews and a recent experience. It has put me off using themWe had a problem. Reported to host in the morning . His reply. Check out and I’ll refund.  … but I don’t expect a bad review  🙄🙄🙄🙄 …. That’s briberySo we sourced another accommodation for that night. ( no problems with this one at all)Checked out, the refund arrived. Only 50% of what we were expecting. Asked why. Host called me a bully as I said I would report on it. Airbnb finally refunded after sending the chat logWhen I wrote a truthful review. The just got it pulled down saying it was coercive. I had warned people to take ear plugs as the noise at might was unbearable from the traffic that seemed to use the road as a racetrack.I appealed and after 2 days of messaging Airbnb would not reinstate itThey just want good reviews and your money",1

Used to be a great service. Not any more. Still great hosts.,Because I used a second email address they established a second account. So after over 15 years and dozens of reservations I appear as a member for just 2 years with no reservations. They don't allow blending accounts. And it has been impossible to acces either account and to give the excellent evaluation my last host deserved. They make you go through some idiotic games to 'identify' yourself.              It used to be a great service. It is a pathetic shadow of that now.,1

Very disorganised,"Booked an apartment in Malaga through Airbnb, arrived at the place late evening, and it was the worst place I’ve ever seen and been to. Cockroaches freely roaming around the place, rotten door frames, blood stain on mattress cover, hole on the duvet cover, stank of damp etc. Contacted Airbnb customer service telling them no one would like to prepare and eat food in a place where cockroaches are walking everywhere, especially as we were traveling with children… after few days of exchanging messages, they offered to give €300 refund which I didn’t accept, then they wrote back with another amount, then the day after they changed the amount again…. Such a disorganised company, and in the meantime they kept pushing me to cancel that apartment through my account so the host can put it back on the website for new guests! I can’t believe they allow a filthy place like that to carry on staying on the website without making any changes. We left the next day of arrival and had to get another place which is very clean and tidy.. I won’t recommend Airbnb to anyone.",1
Beware! Airbnb siding with scamming host,"Host scams seem to be common on this platform. After you leave they’ll enter fake damage and request you to pay. I had trahis issue recently and despite providing proofs I did not do the damages Airbnb sided with host and ask for money. Support is inexistant and will drive you mad, changing contact at every of your message, sending you formatted messages, closing threads without explanation and harassing you by phone. Never again suing this system - too risky, the host model does not work and encourages scams",1
Ignored for Days – Only Took Action After Chargeback,"I booked an Airbnb property in Thailand, which I later discovered was operating illegally—a clear sign posted in the building warned that short-term rentals were prohibited and guests could face prosecution. I flagged this to Airbnb immediately, providing photo evidence and citing their own hosting policies, yet they repeatedly ignored my concerns.After days of silence and canned responses, I was left with no choice but to escalate the matter to my bank and initiate a chargeback. Unsurprisingly, only after the chargeback was opened did Airbnb suddenly begin responding—trying to reroute me through their internal Resolution Center, which I had already made clear I wouldn’t use due to their delayed and inadequate handling.If you’re trusting Airbnb to protect you in serious situations, don’t. Their response was slow, dismissive, and only turned cooperative when financial pressure was applied.",1
Grossly misleading listing and terrible handling from Airbnb,"We are currently staying in Madrid in an apartment booked through Airbnb, and we are deeply disappointed – both with the condition of the apartment and the way Airbnb has handled the situation.Since our arrival, we have been in continuous contact with both the hosts and Airbnb. We raised several serious issues already on Monday – it is now Thursday (17/4-25), and nothing has been resolved. We were first told to wait for the host to contact us. Then we were told to contact the host ourselves. And so it has continued – a frustrating game of ping-pong. We are leaving on Sunday, and it’s clear that no one is taking responsibility.The problems with the apartment are numerous and severe:The front door cannot be properly secured – it only has a sliding bolt at the top. The windows also don’t lock. We do not feel safe.There is a brothel in the same building, and the women working there frequently gather in front of the entrance, shouting and causing disturbances at night. This disrupts our sleep and creates a highly uncomfortable atmosphere.The listing describes the apartment as “quiet and cozy” – this is grossly misleading.The apartment is supposedly equipped for 8 guests, yet there are only 6 chairs and a ridiculous small extendable table.Many of the basic amenities listed were missing upon arrival (shampoo, soap, cleaning cloth, trash bags).Numerous things are broken or in poor condition: the balcony door, blackout blinds, toilet seat, bathroom sink, kitchen cabinets, the TV (which receives no channels), and the WiFi doesn’t reach all the rooms.There is no hot water – we have had to boil water in order to shower.When we used the washing machine, sewage water leaked from an unsealed pipe under in the kitchen resulting the whole apparent to stink of feces.The apartment is dirty and reeks of cigarette smoke despite all windows being closed.The registration of our guests has not been completed correctly, despite my attempts to resolve it with the hosts.We requested a refund and a relocation to another apartment on Tuesday – yet by today, Thursday, the matter is still unresolved.The listing of the apartment in Airbnb is wildly inaccurate and completely misrepresents the true state of the property. In all our years using Airbnb, we have never encountered such a poorly maintained and mismanaged accommodation.Thank you, Airbnb, for turning what should have been a pleasant holiday in Madrid into a frustrating and outrageous experience. We will not be using Airbnb again – and we strongly advise others to stay away as well!",1

Terrible AirBnB,"Terrible AirBnB, removed my review on a traumatic experience at Melbourne Town Hall View Apartment because it didn’t follow their Reviews Policy.I cannot even expressed my honest feelings of the terrible so-called home we came across?!My review was,beware of a Airbnb unit which is marketed as ""Melbourne Town Hall View"" it's a one bedroom which can house upto 4 or 5 (unit number 803). Only the location which is along 115 Swanston Street (in Melbourne CBD) is true, others are jokes. The interior is congested and dirty. Basic hygiene is a major flop. Debris from previous tenants can be found. No Aircon, no TV. Swinging fan is very dusty and broken, cannot swing. Toilet seat is misplaced. Dust every where, if one has breathing issues, beware. Writer paid full for 6 nights but must leave after the first night after the unbearable conditions. Host Srinivasreddy Polareddy is dishonest, rejected to make even partial refunds. He is only eyeing to milk money out of his property at the 8th floor (he is staying on the 10th floor) but not doing enough to upkeep the contents.

"10 Years of Loyalty, Treated Horribly by Airbnb","After almost 10 years of using Airbnb, I’ve now permanently deleted my account. I booked a 1-night stay with my baby and husband and arrived to find a dirty place that looked nothing like the listing.Towels from previous guests were still hanging, a filthy kettle was left in the kitchen (completely unusable), and the host’s personal slippers were waiting at the entrance. The shelves were cluttered, the garden area was unkempt, and there were tools and unsafe items lying around, unacceptable for a family with a small child. I documented everything immediately with timestamped photos and sent them to Airbnb support.Instead of properly addressing the situation, Airbnb offered a small partial refund and allowed the host to leave a false, defamatory review about me, including a completely made-up claim that I “falsified photos.” I declined to share the photos directly with the host (which Airbnb asked permission for) because I was concerned she would retaliate in her review and that’s exactly what she did.Despite having perfect reviews up until this point and providing clear evidence, Airbnb refused to remove her review. It became obvious they are more interested in protecting income from hosts than protecting honest, loyal guests.This was a final wake-up call. If you care about cleanliness, safety, and being treated fairly, I would strongly reconsider using Airbnb.",1
Airbnb turns a blind eye to local law violations and guest safety,"I honestly expected better from Airbnb.I booked a place, found a bedbug crawling in the bed right after check-in, and on top of that, the building had clear signs banning short-term rentals.

Seriously? Was I supposed to sit there and wait to be bitten so I can bleed on their sheets for evidence?At no point did they acknowledge the safety concerns.From the start, they clearly took the host’s side and just kept copy-pasting policy fragments without actually reviewing anything.I used to trust Airbnb, but after this whole absurd process, I’m done.

We arrived at 2 am in the new place where we got relocated and the host didn't accept us for racial reasons: he didn't want to allow my partner in the flat due to his nationality! We had a night of hell trying to get support from AirBnb who was promising help on the phone and closing case after case immediately after the call ended. I was told not to cancel the booking, I was promised help in being relocated, I was promised a refund. Nothing of this was provided and I had to find a new accomodation last minute and more expensive due to lower availability, I have lost one night of sleep and one day of holiday because of this, and now that my holiday is over I am still waiting for a resolution.

Booking made without my knowledge:  Airbnb refused to refund monies,"Airbnb nightmare:  Booking made without my consent   $1200 taken. Airbnb refuse to provide refund nor the details of who booked or device it was booked on etc, despite my pleas *o do so.I went to check my bank account Saturday morning as I have been away a granddaughter who is seriously ill, on the Sunshine Coast.Imagine my shock and horror when seeing a much higher balance owing than there should have been  - $1200 in fact.  Quickly saw the problem - an AirBnB booking I had never made - I havent touched Airbnb for 10 months and that $1200 'stolen' out of my account not authorised by me, is needed for medical interventions not available in Australia.After reporting the issue to ANZ bank, and cancelling my card, they told me to contact Airbnb to see what had happened to get my money back.Well there upon, the joke began - but the joke (and theft) is on me.  AirBnB are shocking and that is too kind a description.  Their customer service is rotten to the core and after trying to find which took hours, they were abysmal.  Flimsy.  Not appropriate at all for a massive institution handling mega funds.First of all I could not understand them.  I asked them to slow down.  The first one just would not, seemingly deliberately making it hard for me.Airbnb's thin pretense of a problem solving complaints department is most certainly not that. just an excuse for one. I had to tell the person I did not understand what the problem was, and that I required a snap shots of who made the booking, time, on what device, messages between host and the person impersonating me.AirBnb said their protocol was a reviewer would contact me when able and give me a decision.  I told them I was not even home at the time of booking but in hospital with my GD who is unresponsive in episodes and that I wear a bum bag around my waist 24 hours so as not to lose or misplace my phone and credit card.The condescending review came back from some one called Leon to say he could find no evidence of interference and I'd basically have to wear the $1200.  End of.  Goodbye.  With no avenue to right of reply or request for further information as these reviews are done by some flimsy phantom entity on no reply emails.   OMG.  ShockingFor the next few hours I sort to get back to reconnect with another reviewer which eventually happened but same response as with Leon.  Washed their hands of me.  I have again been told sorry, you are  not entitled, your bad, basically that someone in   your household must have got hold of your account.  Then goodbye, Airbnb is closing the case and recourse, no more to be heard.  If I report to the issue to police, they  provided a link.   Left hanging like a shag on a rock- excuse my language.How condescending and rude, AirBnb.  You have stolen my money in my book and refuse to provide  me the pathway I have requested showing how whenand where plus what device, this booking was made.  They just ignore my request so I have no way of establishing how this happened, and if it could happen again.  Disgusting almost fraudulent manner of handling peoples money and bookings.  Airbnb stated that the host didnt provide refunds. However when I spoke to the host, she said Airbnb would sure refund the deposit.  So Airbnb is indulging in midleading behavior.  I believe Australia needs to do a full review of Airbnb business practices. as it is clearly substandard and allowed to handle enormous amounts of money.Lesson to be learned:1. remove your credit card from Airbnb site and only install when booking2. Dont trust Airbnb, check your accounts regularly for unauthorised activity on your accountsdid get hold of the host and they were lovely but while I asked, whether rightly or wrongly if they could see their way clear to refunding the almost $1200 paid already, I have had no response but prior to my request, they did say they felt positive Airbnb would refund the $1200 deposit.However in one of the reviewers responses, he stated that the host did not provide refunds, whereas the host in a message said they believed Airbnb would refund my monies taken without my knowledge or consent.  Moral of this story:  remove credit cards in between transactions",1

Even 1 star is too much,Even 1 star is too much! They cancelled our holiday 2 days prior to travelling and they couldn't care less. Didn't apologise or help to find new accommodation. Leaving it so late for us to find and book somewhere new so close to the travel date meant we had to pay even more to find a new booking and when we complained they offered us a voucher only.

Beware of the “golden badge on Airbnb,"Beware of the “golden badge on Airbnb: my experience as a host with 4 propertiesI used to trust Airbnb’s algorithm that assigns the well-known golden badge to listings marked as “guest favorites,” with a percentage showing how they rank compared to others. As a traveler, I often picked listings based on that badge, thinking it was a reliable sign of quality.But now, as a host with years of experience and four different properties listed on the platform, I’ve started to question it—and honestly, I’ve changed my mind.My best-performing listing, a beautiful apartment with a sea view, high-end interiors, an amazing location, glowing 5-star reviews, and a consistently high booking rate… no longer has the golden badge.Meanwhile, my other listings— beautiful as well, same location, same place, in a top position as well, but less popular, no sea view, —still have the badge. This has led me to a simple but disappointing conclusion: the algorithm is not reliable.As someone who manages multiple listings, I’ve been able to compare them directly, and I can confidently say that whether or not a listing has the badge doesn’t always reflect its actual quality or guest satisfaction.MY ADVICE as an experienced host:Don’t rely on the GOLDEN  badge to choose your vacation stay.Always read real REVIEWS, look at the photos, check the details of the home, and pay attention to how the host communicates.The algorithm can be wrong. Real guest experiences aren’t.",4

Disappointed by Airbnb’s Treatment of…,"Disappointed by Airbnb’s Treatment of Longstanding HostsI have been a loyal Airbnb host for over six years, proudly maintaining Superhost status and receiving mostly 5-star reviews from wonderful guests. Hosting has never just been a business to me — it’s something I’ve poured my heart, time, and care into.Unfortunately, my recent experience with Airbnb Support has left me feeling completely disheartened.A guest left a poor review on my listing after a rare, temporary water issue in my town — an external problem entirely beyond my control, which affected many homes in the area. I reached out to Airbnb, not to silence the guest, but to ask for understanding, fairness, and at the very least the chance to update my response to the review professionally.Instead, I was met with rigid, robotic responses, no empathy, and even received a warning threatening suspension from the platform if I receive another low-star review — despite the fact that I have a long, proven track record of excellent hosting. Shockingly, they referenced a 3-star review from last September, completely ignoring the countless 5-star reviews I’ve worked hard to earn.This experience has made me feel that Airbnb no longer values its hosts as people — only as numbers on a screen. There was no kindness, no consideration of the circumstances, and no support for someone who has given years of loyal service to their platform.My hope in writing this review is that Airbnb reflects on how they treat their hosts — especially those who genuinely care and take pride in creating beautiful guest experiences.We deserve to feel valued, supported, and treated with fairness — not fear.",2

Airbnb Allowed a Retaliatory Review to Stay,"Airbnb Allowed a Retaliatory, Misleading Review to Stay—Despite Clear Evidence. Hosts Beware.Hey fellow Hosts,I wanted to share an experience that I believe speaks to a larger issue in how Airbnb handles unfair reviews—and how helpless we can be, even when we follow all the right steps.A recent guest left me a retaliatory and completely misleading review after I reported legitimate issues with their behavior during their stay. I submitted clear evidence showing the review was written solely in retaliation, which is explicitly against Airbnb’s own Review Policy (Article 546). Yet, despite multiple attempts to dispute it, Airbnb not only refused to remove the review but closed my case with vague, copy-pasted replies and no proper explanation.Here’s what I was told:> “The case is now closed… we do not have a way to override it… we appreciate your understanding.”No, I don’t understand—and I won’t quietly accept it.Their “specialized team” never addressed how the review didn’t violate their retaliation or misleading content policy. They simply dismissed it and shut down further appeal.I’ve now started preparing to escalate this externally—to the press, watchdog groups, and online communities—because I believe this case reflects a serious flaw in how Airbnb protects (or fails to protect) its Hosts. If they won’t uphold their own policies, what are we even agreeing to as Hosts?If this has happened to you, please speak up. We need transparency, accountability, and a review system that doesn’t allow bad actors to damage our reputations with impunity.Happy to share the full details privately if anyone is interested—or wants to join forces to get Host voices heard.",1

Significant Safety and Support Concerns with Airbnb,"I recently had a deeply troubling experience during my Airbnb stay in Strasbourg, which has profoundly affected my view of the platform’s commitment to safety and proper host vetting. Below is a summary of my experience:Host Background Checks: The incident underscored a significant flaw in Airbnb's processes—specifically, the absence of comprehensive background checks for hosts. The host displayed erratic and abusive behavior, possibly worsened by untreated health or mental health issues, significantly compromising my safety and comfort.Host Behavior and Eviction: The problems started when the host entered my room without permission after I complained about the lack of adequate heating in the apartment. The situation escalated rapidly, culminating in my being unfairly and abruptly asked to leave the property without any justified reason.Airbnb’s Response: Although Airbnb covered the costs for three nights at a hotel, they did not provide a true refund for the turmoil caused. Moreover, they allowed the host to remain active on the platform, despite clear signs of potentially dangerous behavior.Financial and Emotional Impact: Airbnb's resolution did not fully alleviate the financial burden or the emotional distress I suffered. The urgency of finding emergency accommodations added substantial stress during an already challenging period.Lack of Accountability: Airbnb’s management of the issue revealed a disturbing disregard for serious misconduct by the host. It seemed their main concern was to avoid legal responsibility, rather than to offer real support to the affected guests.Conclusion and Caution to Others: This ordeal has led me to question the reliability of Airbnb for secure accommodations. Prospective guests should be aware of the risks associated with inadequately vetted hosts, particularly regarding their mental and physical health.This experience is a stark reminder for anyone using Airbnb about the inherent risks of the platform. Airbnb needs to enhance its host vetting procedures and accept greater responsibility for guest safety to avoid similar incidents in the future.When you agree to use Airbnb, you essentially accept all risks involved, as the platform does not conduct thorough background checks on hosts. This means a host could potentially have a criminal record and still maintain an active profile on Airbnb.These are the terms of AirBnb -3.2 Your Assumption of Risk. You acknowledge that many activities carry inherent risks and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you assume the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the Airbnb Platform and any Content (as defined in Section 9), including your stay at any Accommodation, participation in any Experience, use of any other Host Service, or any other interaction you have with other Members whether in person or online. This means it is your responsibility to investigate a Host Service to determine whether it is suitable for you. For example, Host Services may carry risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death, and you freely and willfully assume those risks by choosing to participate in those Host Services.",1
Basically feels like a scam,"Basically feels like a scam. Your reservation is not confirmed - it can seemingly be ended at any point, most likely when the owner finds someone who wants to stay longer than you do and their dates include yours >> your 'confirmation' is meaningless, your supposed reservation cancelled without explanation. Also, AirB&B is a US company - make you own mind up if you want to contribute to their earnings.",1
Rubbish Customer support,"First time I have used Airbnb and it's been  a nightmare. I received confirmation of the booking but it was then cancelled because of a problem with verification. Surely verification should be required before a booking is made/confirmed? For the last five days my booing has been confirmed then cancelled. Their customer services awful, of you have a problem  they make it worse.",1
Airbnb 👎🏻,"Title: Extremely disappointed with Airbnb supportI booked accommodation via Airbnb, but due to an issue with the host, I was left without a place to stay. As a result, I had to book another hotel and purchase a new flight. I contacted Airbnb support and provided all evidence, but they only offered me £10 for a situation that cost me several hundred pounds.Their senior case managers kept repeating the same message and refused to take real responsibility. I expected Airbnb to protect its guests and support them when things go wrong. Instead, I was left feeling abandoned and unprotected.I am now forced to file a chargeback through my bank and escalate this case to consumer protection authorities. This was a terrible experience, and I no longer trust Airbnb.#AirbnbFail #PoorSupport #Disappointed",1
They conduct a fraudulent listing of my…,They conduct a fraudulent listing of my property. I tell them to terminate it and they don’t. I tell them to show me the submitted paperwork because my signature must be forged. They won’t. My lawyer is waiting for their fraud department to call. Still waiting. They have the most inexperienced people working there. It’s a nightmare dealing with Airbnb,1
Payment Methods,Paid a deposit (at the time) a current debit card.This card then had fraud on it so the bank cancelled and issued new card.Remainder of holiday was paid on new card. Had cause to cancel holiday and Airbnb claim can't send all monies to new card and can't send to a cancelled card so I've lost £500 !!!They are crooks,1
Disappointed in Airbnb’s Lack of Guest Protection,"Title: Disappointed in Airbnb’s Lack of Guest ProtectionI recently had a really frustrating experience with Airbnb that left me feeling completely unprotected as a guest. The apartment I booked was not clean on arrival — crumbs on the floor, sticky spots, hygiene issues in the bathroom, and missing amenities that were clearly listed. I messaged the host right away, and while she was polite, she insisted her cleaner had been there and said, “This has never happened before,” which felt more like dismissal than accountability.I followed all the proper channels: I documented everything, explained why I couldn’t report within 72 hours (I was alone in a foreign country and afraid I’d be left without housing), and even cleaned the space myself. When I submitted a partial refund request, Airbnb responded by saying it was entirely up to the host to approve — meaning that even if a listing doesn’t match reality, guests have no real protection unless the host agrees to take responsibility.Airbnb claims to support guests, but this experience showed me otherwise. It feels like there’s no meaningful process in place when a stay goes wrong — and no consequences for misleading listings or poor conditions. I didn’t want a full refund, just a fair one. Instead, I was left feeling dismissed, unsupported, and out of options.If Airbnb truly wants to be a trusted platform, it needs to take guest reports seriously and have systems in place that don’t rely solely on the goodwill of hosts.",1
Extremely Disappointing Experience with Airbnb – Lack of Support and Host Negligence,"My experience with Airbnb and the host of an apartment in Curitiba Brazil!!! was extremely negative and disappointing. What should have been a relaxing stay turned into a nightmare.Upon arriving at the property, I noticed serious safety issues: the apartment, located on the 15th floor, had no window screens, which posed a significant risk, especially since I was sick and accompanied by my young grandson. When I asked the host to install window screens, he responded insensitively and negligently, saying he raised his daughter in the same environment and ""nothing happened."" This was irresponsible and disrespectful of my safety and that of other guests.Additionally, the advertised single bed was not suitable; it was actually a low children's bed, something the host admitted but minimized. Despite not using the apartment even for a single night, the host refused to refund the full amount and insisted I pay 50% of the stay.The worst part was the lack of support from Airbnb. I had to resolve the dispute with the help of my bank, as Airbnb did nothing to assist me. Furthermore, the host changed the listing after my complaint, adding the information about the lack of window screens, which was never mentioned in the original listing. This clearly shows an attempt to hide flaws after the fact.Today, I am no longer seeking a refund, as my bank handled the situation. What I really want is to report this kind of behavior so that other guests don’t go through the same ordeal.Warning to everyone: If you're booking with Airbnb, carefully check reviews and be prepared to deal with the platform's lack of support.",1
Business information,"In the recent upgrade of business information Airbnbs processes for upgrading information did not have knowledge of the New Zealand tax laws.

We have had 30+ emails from Airbnb and even when they say I am done, no they come back with something else that they need. The system is flawed!

Airbnb chose to leave this comment as it is, i.e.: on my profile forever, affecting all my future stays. Also, that place was of health hazards full of bed bugs and Airbnb did nothing to warn the future guests, in fact, they refused to let us comment about that fact when we tried to.

Airbnb raised uncomfortable reviews.  Of course to make more money.,Need to close them down. I’m starting,1
Airbnb’s Deceptive Cancellation Policy and Unaccountability,"Airbnb, this is unacceptable.We recently booked a stay through Airbnb and were met with a clearly misleading cancellation policy. The listing read:“Free cancellation for 48 hours. Get a full refund if you change your mind.”Naturally, we understood this to mean cancellation was allowed up to 48 hours before check-in — as is standard in most booking platforms. Only after trying to cancel (five days in advance) did we learn it actually meant 48 hours after booking. This deceptive wording is not the host’s doing — it’s Airbnb’s platform design.Airbnb refused to take responsibility, falling back on technical fine print and ignoring the misleading nature of the language. Its support claimed we “had the option” to read the full policy. However, the listing wording gave us no reason to think that was necessary. It created a false sense of flexibility and led us to believe we were within our rights to cancel.As longtime users of the platform, we’re deeply disappointed by this lack of transparency and customer support.We’re sharing this to help others avoid the same experience — and to hold Airbnb accountable for what we believe amounts to misleading advertising.",1

Airbnb let me book an illegal rental in…,"Airbnb let me book an illegal rental in Thailand, then refused to take responsibilityI booked an apartment in Thailand through Airbnb for 16 days. I later learned that this type of short-term rental violates Thai law (the Hotel Act), which prohibits rentals of less than 30 days without a hotel license.The host explicitly told me not to mention Airbnb at the front desk — clearly trying to hide the booking. I have screenshots of this conversation.When I contacted Airbnb customer service, they:- refused to pay any compensation,- did not apologize,- and most importantly, admitted that they do not check the legality of listings.Direct quote from their response:“Airbnb does not conduct due diligence on each listing or confirm compliance with local laws in each jurisdiction.”In other words, Airbnb is fully aware that listings on their platform may be illegal, but they continue to accept them — and profit from them — while passing on all the legal risks to guests.I also informed Airbnb that I may file a complaint with the Thai tourist police, as I was not warned that the rentals may be illegal. Airbnb's response? ""Case closed.""Case ID: A46070227My conclusion:Airbnb is not responsible — even when their users are exposed to potentially illegal situations. This is dangerous, unethical, and completely unacceptable. If you are traveling to countries with strict short-term rental laws (Thailand, Japan, Italy, etc.) — Airbnb will not protect you.",1

Harsh penalties with no flexibility,"I am writing as an airbnb host of a very successful self catering holiday let. I have a near perfect record, all 5 stars from 350 reviews with one 4 star. My place is booked year round so I earn airbnn approx £5,000 a year in host and guest commission. A couple of months ago I had a Christmas booking for 2025. I cancelled it. I am not in the habit of cancelling guests. This is my first in 4 years. But I gave them 10 months notice so they had plenty of time to find something else. As a result of this I've paid 10% penalty of the cost of the booking, I've lost my superhost status and I've been made less visible in searches. I complained to airbnb about this and was informed this is their policy. There is no flexibility to allow for the fact that I have an excellent record or that I gave the guests 10 months notice. I am disgusted by my treatment.",1
I am very sad,"Airbnb deceives its customers. The user interface and usability on the mobile app are lacking. It's easy to accidentally press the wrong button, resulting in an unintended booking. One feature, apparently, is that when you search for an accommodation and send a booking request, the property later reappears in the search results. Now, the same property shows as unavailable for the dates you're looking for. Naturally, you think the host has later marked the property as unavailable. However, it's actually Airbnb that continues to suggest this property to the user.I personally experienced this when I thought the property was unavailable and began searching for an alternative, which I found and booked. Almost simultaneously, the host of the first property confirmed the booking, and suddenly, I had two accommodations booked. It was impossible to explain this situation to customer support.""The accessibility of the support is very poor. Firstly, the people only speak broken German or English, whichever it may be. Reliable callbacks are offered, but they do not happen. What makes me suspicious is that on the answering machine, it is mentioned that I will be contacted by a member of Airbnb. It should be correct to say that employees are being mentioned, not members—what’s the deal with that?""It's sad that such a large company uses these methods to improve quarterly results and present itself better to investors.""The support is almost impossible to reach, the staff doesn't speak the language, and they don't follow through with their promise to call back after they’ve looked into the issue. In the future, I will only use Airbnb for emergencies. If possible, I’ll book directly with the provider, as that’s an option if you know how.""",1
I recently discovered unauthorized…,"I recently discovered unauthorized charges were withdrawn from my account in regards to a recent stay at one of my properties. The guest has already received all of their money back, but I had the absolute unpleasure of working with Luna with Airbnb who has repeatedly messaged me regarding the issues with my home, sending threatening and rude messages. After I asked her not to message me, she continued to send messages. One being 9:45PM. When I asked her not to send messages after 9PM, she sent the next one at 1:30AM. Then, because I got angry with her, now she is retaliating by taking $370 dollars from my account! This is THEFT!  When I call, no one will talk to me, call me, resolve this ... NOTHING. Now, they are just going to steal money from my account after this issues was ALREADY PAID OUT! They have taken over $3,000 from my account in the last 3 months!! How is this legal?? This is not the level of professionalism or transparency I expect from a global company. I am requesting a full investigation into the unauthorized charges and a formal explanation of the billing practices. I also urge Airbnb to improve their customer support and communication processes.

Exceptional Support from Airbnb During…,"Exceptional Support from Airbnb During the Bangkok EarthquakeOur stay in Bangkok took an unexpected turn when we experienced an earthquake. It was a nerve-wracking experience, but Airbnb’s Safety Team—especially Amy, Simona, Eric, and Ronnie—stepped in immediately and made sure we were safe and supported.From the moment they reached out, they showed genuine concern, checking in regularly and offering assistance. They not only provided clear communication but also offered to cover hotel costs if we needed to relocate. Knowing we had that option gave us peace of mind in an otherwise stressful situation. When we needed to find a longer-term stay, they even helped with a booking coupon to cover part of the cost.The original property was great, but what truly stood out was the level of care and professionalism from the Airbnb team. In a moment of uncertainty, they made us feel valued and reassured. This experience has given me an even greater appreciation for Airbnb—not just as a platform, but as a company that genuinely prioritizes its guests.Huge thanks to Amy, Simona, Eric, and Ronnie for everything. Your kindness and quick action made all the difference!⸻",5

Message to all guests from a super host. DON’T BOOK ON THIS PLATFORM,I am a superhost on Airbnb. Last year on a new property I listed I received an early review of a 3 from a guest who retaliated to my requests that they keep the after hours noise down for fellow residents in the building (it’s a no-party unit so no excuse).Part of the review stated a “dirty stairwell with excessive dust” for the communal stairs and gave a 2 for cleaning! I’ve been a host for 8 years and my places are spotless.Airbnb ignored my protest and request to remove the review.ALL SUBSEQUENT REVIEWS ON THIS APARTMENT HAVE SCORED ME A 5* rating so I was absolutely horrified to be told last week by Airbnb that my listing will be REMOVED on May 2nd because I got a 3* review last year 😳 😱I immediately appealed and took screenshots of all the subsequent excellent reviews. To no avail. I’ve been advised they will “uphold” their decision and remove my listing.I have 42 guests who have booked with me between now and September - I now have to create a new listing on booking.com and try to get the guests to trust me and move across. I still have the property and still have the ability to host … it’s ridiculous!If you are a guest reading this DONT BOOK ON THIS PLATFORM.

Awful company,"Awful company. The host of the place I booked for my 30th birthday cancelled 3 weeks after accepting as they wanted more money (we had booked 2 days over the May bank holiday weekend originally but she comes back as says she needs to offer it to people who can stay over the full 3 days). This is 3 weeks after confirming our booking and we had prepared everything for our trip. The host told Air B & B that they couldn't have us stay because the property was under maintenance but we have a message from the host which clearly states she needs a booking over the full 3 days and not 2. We rang Air B&B and spent over an hour trying to raise a complaint to be put on hold over and over again, as they hoped we would hang up. We eventually managed to speak to a 'manager' who said the call was recorded for training and monitoring purposes. When we responded saying we are also recording the call, they quickly hung up the phone as they know they weren't complying with the correct complaint process. We then requested a full refund for the trip, but were instead given air b and b credits with a petty £32 compensation which doesn't even cover the train tickets my friends bought to get to the house. We have never dealt with such an unprofessional company in our entire lives and will never use this company ever again. And now we have less than 2 months left to try and organise a 30th birthday for 16 people which has caused a huge amount of time and distress. DO NOT USE AIR B&B if we had read the reviews before we would have ran a mile!",1
Never Again!!!,After driving 16 hours I looked forward to what Air B&B advertised as a quiet private place was nothing of the sort! No mention that a family of 5 with 3 small children would be staying 5 feet away from me in my so called quiet/private place. I called Air B&B to cancel my stay 15 minuites after arriving. They thought it was fair to keep half of the over $500 I paid for 4 nights! Do yourself a favor & forget Air B&B and checkout places when you get to your destination instead of relying on their BS advertising description & pics of the places that might have been nice years ago!,1

"Traumatizing, Discriminatory Experience & Zero Accountability from Airbnb","I’m sharing this in the hope that no one else has to go through what I experienced. I was forcibly removed from this property based on false and discriminatory accusations made by the host and building manager. The manager called the police, who conducted a public stop-and-search. Despite the humiliation and anxiety this caused, I cooperated fully. The police found no drugs, no rule-breaking, and confirmed there was no evidence of any wrongdoing.I followed all the house rules. Yet I was publicly accused, humiliated, and evicted. What’s worse is that I was the only guest targeted—despite the smell of cannabis throughout the property and other white, elderly guests staying at the same time. They were never questioned. I was singled out, and I firmly believe this was because I am a young Black woman. The treatment I received was discriminatory, dehumanizing, and completely unjust.To make matters worse, Airbnb canceled my reservation shortly after the police left—without ever contacting me for my side of the story. I was left without accommodation at short notice, no support, no rebooking help, and no offer of care or protection under their AirCover policy.I paid for 16 nights, stayed for only 9, and despite being entitled to a refund, I have not been refunded the remaining amount—over £1,000. Airbnb has yet to contact me directly or provide a full resolution, despite multiple attempts on my end and clear documentation proving I did nothing wrong.This has been a deeply traumatic experience. I trusted Airbnb to provide a safe, fair service and uphold its policies. Instead, I was met with silence, discrimination, and abandonment.I’m speaking up because this kind of mistreatment and lack of accountability should never happen—especially on a platform that claims to care about guest safety and inclusion.",1

"Bedbug nightmare – no protection, no help from Airbnb","I booked what seemed to be a clean and decent apartment through Airbnb – not a cheap place, but one at a normal, fair price. After two days, we discovered small bugs in the bed. On the third day, after a quick Google search, it became clear: bedbugs.We immediately informed the host. Our vacation was ruined – we simply couldn’t continue. We also contacted Airbnb support right away, reporting an active bedbug infestation. The result? A small refund for the affected stay – but all other costs were left entirely up to us.I brought the bedbugs back home with me and had to hire a professional exterminator, which cost over €500. On top of that, I tried countless anti-bedbug treatments while waiting for the exterminator appointment. I had to pay for all of this myself. Airbnb only covers a small amount for laundry – that’s it. They won’t take responsibility for anything else.I had never dealt with bedbugs before and was completely overwhelmed. Airbnb later claimed that I should’ve undressed outside and sealed everything immediately for cleaning – but they never gave me any of this advice, not even when I first reported the issue. We were left to deal with it all on our own.Airbnb provides no hygiene guarantee and takes no real responsibility for the hosts on their platform.No support. No solution. No proper communication. Just psychological and logistical stress – all at your own expense.I trusted Airbnb – and was deeply disappointed.Never again.",1

They said it was our fault for not notifying them immediately, mind you we were only staying 2 nights and many of the issues could not of been solved immediately there was mold, broken alarms, broken appliances and many more issues.

Airbnb Double-Charged Service Fees and Refused,"I recently had an extremely disappointing experience with Airbnb's refund policy and customer service that I feel compelled to share.I had to cancel a 5-night reservation after the full refund window but before the 50% refund deadline. The host graciously offered to refund me once the dates were rebooked, stating: ""I can refund you once the days are rebooked. You would receive the difference if our price ended up being lower.""Based on this promise, I immediately canceled my reservation to give the host maximum time to rebook (rather than waiting until the 50% refund deadline which would have guaranteed me a partial refund).When the dates were rebooked, multiple issues arose:1. The host claimed one date wasn't rebooked despite Airbnb's system showing it as unavailable2. The refund calculation suggested an unusually low rebooking rate with no transparency3. Most importantly, Airbnb collected service fees TWICE for the same property on the same dates - once from me and once from the new guestDespite multiple polite requests to Airbnb support explaining this double-charging issue, they repeatedly refused to refund even the service fee portion (approximately $250), citing rigid policy adherence while ignoring the fundamental unfairness of collecting fees twice for the same dates.Airbnb's unwillingness to address this obvious case of double-dipping on service fees has permanently damaged my trust in their platform. I've been a loyal customer for years but will be exploring alternatives for future travel.Beware of Airbnb's refund policies - even when a host agrees to refund you based on rebooking, Airbnb will still keep all their service fees, essentially profiting twice from the same reservation dates.",1
Feedback on Retaliatory Review – Request for Policy Reconsideration,"I would like to provide feedback on a recent review removal request I submitted, which was denied. As a Superhost with over three years of consistently positive feedback, I am disappointed that the review in question, which I believe to be retaliatory, was not removed.The guest in question violated house rules, including arriving before check-in, and later left a negative review after being reminded of those rules. This type of retaliatory review undermines the fairness of the review system, as it does not reflect an honest assessment of the stay.While I understand that the decision is final, I would like to suggest that more careful consideration be given to cases where retaliation is evident, especially when a host has a long-standing record of positive reviews and professionalism.I hope future policies will offer more support to hosts in dealing with retaliatory reviews.Best regards,Ayoub",1

Slapped with a 41% extra fee and told to accept or cancel,"I booked an apartment through Airbnb in January for a stay in April. Then, out of nowhere in March, the host messaged me saying they “made a calculation error” and increased the price by 234€—from 560€ to 794€. That’s a 41% increase, after the booking was confirmed and paid for.I contacted Airbnb support expecting help. Instead, I got told to either “accept the new price or cancel.” That’s it. No protection. No real recourse.I had to dig through Airbnb’s own host policies, which clearly say that once a booking is made, the price can’t be changed unless the guest agrees—and if the guest refuses, the host is expected to cancel. So why did the whole issue get pushed on to me instead of the host?Airbnb offered me a 20% discount on the price difference (only the difference!!) if I rebooked elsewhere in their application—meaning I still get to pay more, just a bit less more. That’s not compensation, that’s a joke.To make matters worse, when I tried to leave feedback about this support experience, the review link had conveniently expired by the time I got my refund. And of course, I couldn’t review the host either, because I didn’t end up staying—even though I wanted to.This platform protects its hosts, not its guests. Hosts can change the deal, and Airbnb won’t back you up. Instead, you’re left scrambling or paying extra. Total lack of accountability, and a support system that just pushes you toward refunding and no repercussions for the host.",1
Airbnb gave strangers access to my apartment—and now wants me to pay again to relocate,"I’m a female with a disability (multiple sclerosis) and a registered service dog. I booked a 1-month Airbnb in Vigo, Spain (Rua Pracer 19, 1º Izquierda), and paid nearly €1000 for four weeks. But within the first two weeks, four different sets of neighbors were able to unlock my private apartment door using their Airbnb-issued digital app (AKILES system).Yes—four different sets of strangers were given access to my home by the Airbnb host. And Airbnb is perfectly okay with this.One group entered in the middle of the night while I was asleep. I was lucky—my service dog barked and scared them away. The others opened the door during the day, believing the apartment was theirs—because the app told them so.Airbnb gave the same access link to multiple guests.My apartment became a garage sale labeled “take anything you want.”No cameras. No lock changes. No accountability from the host or Airbnb.I was terrified to leave for days. I had to stay on lockdown inside the apartment and place a heavy suitcase behind the door at night, afraid someone else would enter again.I have multiple sclerosis—and stress worsens my condition.This situation was nothing but stress, fear, and complete insecurity.Every single time I reported an incident, they told me the issue was “fixed.” They even sent screenshots. So I went to the latest neighbor and asked him to test it.Guess what? He opened my door. Again. I filmed it.And what does Airbnb offer me now?•	Not a proper relocation.•	Not a real solution.•	No apology. No compensation.Instead, they offer 1–3 nights in a hotel (paid upfront by me), or 7 nights in another Airbnb (also paid upfront by me).Let that sink in:They want me to PAY AGAIN, upfront.Let me be clear:•	I already paid for 4 weeks.•	I only “enjoyed” 2 of them—if you can call it that.•	I still have 2 weeks left, already paid and unused.•	And Airbnb wants me to pay again to be relocated.How is that not a scam?They refuse to take responsibility.They gaslight—sending copy-pasted replies like “we’re sorry you feel that way,” while ignoring every piece of evidence I’ve provided.They have video evidence, screenshots, and a full chat log showing they allowed unauthorized entries and still failed to protect me, my health, my service dog, and my belongings.This is not customer service.This is not a “misunderstanding.”This is corporate negligence, discrimination, gaslighting, and a total failure to protect the safety and rights of their guests. And it is illegal, because they allowed strangers to repeatedly break into my rental.Airbnb: You endangered me. You endangered my service dog. You violated my privacy. You’ve done nothing but deflect.And now you expect me to pay for your mistake?I don’t think so.This will not stay silent.",1
Never Ever anymore Airbnb! Super insecure and no any clients support in practice,"Literally, I wish I could give Zero, but there is none of those grades!!Terrible clients and security support! I booked a space from the host in Madrid which was presumably rated as a good one, but it's such a cheating! She is not only mislead with infos and space description which is literally terrible to stay in where everything is broken, you can't use even warm water to take a shower because the host put only 100 litres and she rents even the space to several people (different rooms) what I wasn't aware prior coming to Madrid!! I was really speechless, but this was a least problem with all broken stuff etc.The host is revealed to be super below any reasonable educated people, who not only lied with infos about the space, but also insulted me because of towel with some blood spots (I had an accident) yelling at me. Besides, she entered my space while I was away checking my stuff ( I could notice it right immediately when I came to my room for change for another art event from ARCO in Madrid), plus I had my cards around on there table, etc.But, Airbnb, while being provided with all my messaged and screenshots, after weeks of so called ""investigation"" reverted to me saying that they didn't notice any private intrusion for my space and that I have to read their terms and policy. In fact, it's written that it's violation when host enters guests space without any reason, without noticing, but Airbnb doesn't want to block this host. No wonder, they profiting a lot and don't really care about the guests security! I'm going to bring this case out, plus contacting to CEOs plus asking attorney/lawyer to claim this company!! Hopefully, people will stop using this ignorant and super unprofessional platform! No secure and no guarantee.Hypothetically, if tomorrow, the host will attack me, I'm afraid the Airbnb won't do anything!Should this situation happen in Austria, where police does its job, and where I speak German, of course, I would have called to police immediately, where host would get troubles!",1
🚨 Airbnb Scammed Me & Let a Host Retaliate 🚨,"I booked an Airbnb-recommended listing, only to find out it was possibly fake—the host canceled last minute and pushed me into an off-platform apartment. The unit was dirty, unprepared, and missing key access, forcing me to rely on building security to enter.I reported everything to Airbnb support, who promised me a full refund. But instead of holding the host accountable, Airbnb let her leave a completely false, retaliatory review accusing me of trashing the apartment (I have photo proof that it was spotless when I left).Even worse? An Airbnb rep CONFIRMED the review was retaliatory and should be removed—yet Airbnb refuses to do anything. Now, I’m stuck with a fake bad review AND no refund.Why is Airbnb protecting fraudulent hosts? Why are they recommending inactive or fake listings? Why are they ignoring their own policies?This isn’t just bad customer service—it’s outright fraud and negligence. If Airbnb won’t fix this, I’ll be taking further action.@Airbnb, do better.#AirbnbScam #AirbnbFraud #AirbnbProblems",1
Airbnb does not follow its own policies…,"Airbnb does not follow its own policies and seems to change the rules whenever it suits them. I have caught them lying multiple times and using bullying tactics to push their own agenda rather than fairly handling disputes. Instead of holding hosts and guests accountable according to their stated policies, they manipulate situations to their benefit.Customer service is useless—they give generic responses, avoid answering direct questions, and refuse to take responsibility for clear policy violations. If you have an issue, don’t expect fairness or transparency. Airbnb protects itself, not its users",1
Beware of Dishonest Hosts and Airbnb’s…,"Beware of Dishonest Hosts and Airbnb’s Unfair Policies!We stayed at Tom and Richard’s stone cottage in Bloomville, spent an entire morning cleaning before leaving, and were promised a 5-star review—only for Tom to turn around and falsely accuse us of leaving trash everywhere. Despite sending proof to Airbnb, they refused to remove the lies and wouldn’t let us update our review. To make it worse, we later discovered Tom has a history of doing this to people of color. Airbnb sided with them, and we’re done with this platform—moving to Vrbo instead!",1
Better than booking,"Better than booking, but i think it should be better at all",4
They do not follow regulations to protect customers,"Airbnb do not follow the PSD2 Strong Customer Authentication regulation which is in effect, meaning additional checks are required to protect customers from online fraud. As a result, my UK bank declines transactions. Airbnb customer support are very nice and polite, but all they can suggest is to pay with PayPal. This is not helpful.",1
Last time I’ll be using Airbnb,Last time I’ll be using Airbnb! Tried booking using the payment method Klarna - payment was taken by AIRBNB as stated on my bank statement but they are refusing to admit any wrongdoing and keep saying there is no payment on their side. I’ve shown the screenshot of $491.85 taken by their company on my bank statement and they’re still saying they can’t see any transaction!,1

Extremely disappointed in Airbnb’s resolution process and lack of accountability.",1

The Airbnb property had several issues…,"The Airbnb property had several issues from the beginning of my stay. I initially hoped the host would address and resolve the problems, but after a few days, the host stopped responding entirely. I waited for 10 days without any communication, then contacted Airbnb support to report the following issues:Essential supplies were not replenishedThe main door lock batteries were deadLocks on the bedroom and bathroom doors were not workingOther general maintenance problemsAirbnb informed me that I could either continue my stay or leave the property, and they would provide a 30% discount/credit for the affected duration. Given the location of my children’s school, moving to another Airbnb was not a practical option, so I chose to stay despite the unresolved issues.Throughout the remainder of my stay, neither the host nor Airbnb made any effort to resolve these problems. Then on March 27, 2025, Airbnb issued a refund of only $81.37 as compensation, which does not reflect the level of inconvenience experienced by me and my family.Additionally, during a more recent call, Airbnb mentioned their “AirCover” policy for the first time—this was not brought up or explained during my earlier conversations with their support team. This lack of transparency further contributed to the poor experience and confusion around my rights and available options.",1
"English: Booking not accepted, left on the street with two kids – no help from Airbnb","On March 27, I booked a stay in Ulm for myself and my two small children through Airbnb, with a check-in time of 14:00. The system allowed me to request the booking at 12:34, only 26 minutes before check-in, without any warning that the host may have up to 24 hours to respond. The host never replied, and we were left standing in a foreign city with no accommodation and two young kids.I contacted Airbnb support and was told that ""the system works as expected"" – but how can it be acceptable that a booking request is accepted just before check-in, with no guarantee of confirmation?No responsibility was taken, no compensation was offered, and my complaint was dismissed. This is unacceptable and dangerous, especially for families. Airbnb's system design creates risks, and the company does not protect its users when things go wrong.I strongly advise others to think twice before using Airbnb.Am 27. März habe ich über Airbnb eine Unterkunft in Ulm für mich und meine zwei kleinen Kinder gebucht – mit Check-in um 14:00 Uhr. Die Plattform hat meine Buchungsanfrage um 12:34 Uhr zugelassen, nur 26 Minuten vorher, ohne jeglichen Hinweis darauf, dass der Gastgeber bis zu 24 Stunden Zeit für die Antwort hat. Der Gastgeber hat nicht reagiert, und wir standen ohne Unterkunft in einer fremden Stadt.Der Airbnb-Support sagte mir lediglich: „Das System funktioniert wie erwartet.“ Aber wie kann es richtig sein, eine Buchung so kurz vor dem Check-in zu ermöglichen, ohne die rechtzeitige Bestätigung sicherzustellen?Airbnb hat keine Verantwortung übernommen, keine Hilfe angeboten, und meine Beschwerde wurde abgelehnt. Das ist fahrlässig, unsicher und familienfeindlich.Ich kann Airbnb unter diesen Umständen nicht weiterempfehlen.",1
Host added additional costs at the end of the booking process,"I booked an apartment in Sicily and at the very end of the process (I had even paid the down payment), the host added 74E to the price. I questioned it but they stood firm. I tried to contact airbnb but it was frustratingly difficult. I had 24 hours to find somewhere else to stay or cancel my flight. I felt exhausted and couldn't find anywhere else to stay that I liked, so I cancelled my flight, which cost me £50. I have cancelled my account with airbnb and will not use them again. Anyone who cares about housing issues should not use them either.",1

Artificial Insanity,"I am a host. It's over 2 months that they hold the payments of 3 bookings. The assistance is inefficient, inadequate, frustrating: they ask for a document that I sent them several times, and every time they ask for the same thing as if I didn't send it.  I think this service is managed by A.I. But beyond them there is an Artificial Insanity. I say this because don't want to think to a worse reason: holding the money you manage on behalf of someone else in my country is a crime",1

We were falsely accuses by an apartment owner that we done a small damage to a chair. We disputed it but the money were taken out of my account anyway. I had no say in it.

Why does it need anything else, it's not a bloody bank..!!I remember having to complain a while ago about their last security login system they implemented, which was also cumbersome, useless, and that also locked me out of my account..",1
This company has become a SCAM,"This company has become a SCAM, absent customer service, the higher teams can't do their job, keeping a fake claim open for 2 weeks when the claim is 0 euros, and the host is not giving proofs for 2 weeks this stupid and fake and useless claim is still open. They make money on us but they don't give any customer service! Airbn website is good JUST BECAUSE THE APARTMENTS ARE GOOD but that has got nothing to do with the company, the company has become very bad over the years. 0 customer service, 0 capable people",1
